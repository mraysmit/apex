This folder is for YAML files generated by JetBrains MPS.

How it works:
- Place any *.yaml or *.yml files you generate here.
- The JUnit test dev.mars.apex.demo.validation.MpsGeneratedYamlValidationTest scans this folder.
- Each file is loaded using the standard YamlConfigurationLoader to verify compatibility with the APEX engine.

Quick steps:
1) Generate YAML from your MPS project into this directory.
2) From the repository root, run: mvn -pl apex-demo -am test
3) Fix any errors reported by the test and re-run.
