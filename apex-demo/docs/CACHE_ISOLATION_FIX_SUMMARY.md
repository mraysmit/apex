## Investigation: Duplicate Data Source Tests Cache State Interference

### Root Cause Identified

The duplicate data source tests were failing due to **cache state interference** when run in the full test suite. The issue was:

1. **ApexCacheManager is a Singleton** - The cache manager instance persists across all tests
2. **Cache Statistics are Cumulative** - Statistics counters accumulate across the entire test run
3. **Tests Check Specific Statistics** - The duplicate tests expect exactly 1 cache miss and 1 cache hit
4. **Previous Tests Pollute Cache** - When run after other tests, the cache statistics include data from previous tests

### Example Failure Scenario

When `DuplicateDatabaseDataSourceTest.testDatabaseDatasetDeduplicationWithCacheStatistics` runs:
- **Expected:** 1 miss, 1 hit (50% hit rate)
- **Actual (in full suite):** 3 misses, 5 hits (62.5% hit rate) - because previous tests added to the statistics

### Solution Implemented

**1. Clear Cache in DemoTestBase.setUp()**
```java
ApexCacheManager cacheManager = ApexCacheManager.getInstance();
cacheManager.clearAll();
cacheManager.getAllStatistics().values().forEach(stats -> stats.reset());
```

**2. Reset Statistics in Duplicate Tests**
```java
// In testDatabaseDatasetDeduplicationWithCacheStatistics()
cacheManager.clearAll();
cacheManager.getAllStatistics().values().forEach(stats -> stats.reset());
```

### Files Modified

1. **apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/DemoTestBase.java**
   - Added import: `dev.mars.apex.core.cache.ApexCacheManager`
   - Modified setUp() to clear cache and reset statistics

2. **apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/datasources/database/DuplicateDatabaseDataSourceTest.java**
   - Modified testDatabaseDatasetDeduplicationWithCacheStatistics() to reset statistics

3. **apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/datasources/inline/DuplicateInlineDataSourceTest.java**
   - Modified testDatasetDeduplicationWithCacheStatistics() to reset statistics

## Test Results

### Before Cache Isolation Fix
- Total Tests: 554
- Passing: 545 (98.4%)
- Failing: 9 (1.6%)

### After Cache Isolation Fix
- Total Tests: 554
- Passing: 551 (98.5%)
- Failing: 3 (0.5%)

### Improvement
- **Tests Fixed:** 6 (from 9 failures to 3 failures)
- **Failures Reduced:** 67% (9 → 3)
- **Pass Rate Improvement:** +0.1% (98.4% → 98.5%)

## Remaining Failures (3)

### 1. DuplicateDatabaseDataSourceTest (1 failure)
- **Test:** testDatabaseDatasetDeduplicationWithCacheStatistics
- **Status:** STILL FAILING in full suite, PASSES individually
- **Root Cause:** Cache statistics still being polluted despite reset attempts

### 2. DuplicateInlineDataSourceTest (1 failure)
- **Test:** testDatasetDeduplicationWithCacheStatistics
- **Status:** STILL FAILING in full suite, PASSES individually
- **Root Cause:** Cache statistics still being polluted despite reset attempts

### 3. SimplePipelineTest (1 failure)
- **Status:** FAILING in full suite
- **Root Cause:** Unknown - requires investigation

## Key Insights

### Cache Statistics Behavior
- `clearAll()` clears cache entries but does NOT reset statistics
- `CacheStatistics.reset()` must be called explicitly to reset counters
- Statistics are tracked per cache scope (dataset, lookup-result, expression, service-registry)

### Test Isolation Challenges
- Singleton pattern makes it difficult to isolate tests
- Cache statistics accumulate across entire test run
- Tests that check specific statistics values are vulnerable to interference

### Recommended Improvements
1. Consider resetting ApexCacheManager singleton between tests
2. Add method to ApexCacheManager to reset all statistics at once
3. Consider using separate cache instances per test
4. Document cache isolation requirements for test developers

---

## Conclusion

Successfully reduced failures from 9 to 3 by implementing cache clearing and statistics reset in the test base class. The remaining 3 failures appear to be due to deeper cache state issues that may require architectural changes to fully resolve.

**Current Achievement:** 98.5% Pass Rate (551/554 tests passing)
