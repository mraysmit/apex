# Settlement Instruction Multi-Parameter Enrichment Rules - Database Version
# Demonstrates complex multi-parameter database lookup enrichment using APEX YAML processing
# Use Case: Enrich trades with settlement instructions and risk assessment data from database

# ============================================================================
# APEX YAML Configuration File
# ============================================================================
# Used by: ORPHANED - No Java test currently uses this file
# Purpose: Settlement instruction enrichment demonstration using APEX lookup
#          enrichments for settlement processing, instruction validation, and
#          post-trade settlement operations with comprehensive settlement data
# Status: Available for integration with settlement instruction enrichment tests
