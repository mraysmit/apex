# ============================================================================
# APEX YAML Configuration File - Negative Severity Validation Testing
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Test invalid severity values and edge cases to ensure proper
#          error handling and validation in the APEX severity system
# Used by: SeverityNegativeTest.java

# NOTE: These rules contain intentionally invalid severity values
# They should cause validation errors when loaded by the APEX system

rules:
  # Test Case 1: Invalid severity value - should cause ConfigurationException

    condition: "true"
    message: "This rule has an invalid severity value"
    severity: "CRITICAL"  # Invalid - not in {ERROR, WARNING, INFO}

  # Test Case 6: Numeric severity - should cause ConfigurationException
  - id: "invalid-severity-numeric"
    name: "Invalid Severity Numeric"
    condition: "true"
    message: "This rule has a numeric severity value"
    severity: "1"  # Invalid - severity must be string enum
    priority: 1

  # Test Case 7: Mixed case severity - should test case sensitivity
  - id: "mixed-case-severity-error"
    name: "Mixed Case Severity Error"
    condition: "true"
    message: "This rule has mixed case severity"
    severity: "error"  # Test: should this be normalized to "ERROR"?
    priority: 1

  # Test Case 8: Mixed case severity - should test case sensitivity
  - id: "mixed-case-severity-warning"
    name: "Mixed Case Severity Warning"

    severity: "Warning"  # Test: should this be normalized to "WARNING"?
    priority: 1

  # Test Case 9: Mixed case severity - should test case sensitivity
  - id: "mixed-case-severity-info"
    name: "Mixed Case Severity Info"
    condition: "true"
    message: "This rule has mixed case severity"
    severity: "info"  # Test: should this be normalized to "INFO"?
    priority: 1

  # Test Case 10: Empty string severity - should cause validation error
  - id: "empty-severity"
    name: "Empty Severity"
    condition: "true"
    message: "This rule has empty severity"
    severity: ""  # Invalid - empty string

  # Test Case 11: Whitespace severity - should cause validation error
  - id: "whitespace-severity"

  # Test Case 12: Special characters in severity - should cause validation error
  - id: "special-chars-severity"
    name: "Special Characters Severity"
    condition: "true"
    message: "This rule has special characters in severity"
    severity: "ERROR!"  # Invalid - contains special characters
    priority: 1

# NOTE: Rule groups are intentionally omitted from this file
# as the focus is on testing individual rule severity validation
# Rule group testing with invalid severities would be handled
# in the rule group specific test files

# Test Cases for Missing Severity Field:
# These test cases cannot be represented in YAML as they involve
# completely omitting the severity field, which would be tested
# programmatically in the Java test classes:
#
# Test Case A: Rule with no severity field - should default to "INFO"
# Test Case B: Rule with null severity field - should default to "INFO"
# Test Case C: Rule with undefined severity field - should default to "INFO"
