# APEX FAILURE POLICY DEMONSTRATION: ENRICHMENT SCENARIO CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This scenario configuration demonstrates enrichment stage behavior under
# failure policies. It shows how enrichment processing continues even when
# validation stages fail with "continue-with-warnings" policy.

# This scenario has multiple stages where validation may fail but enrichment should execute
