# APEX YAML Configuration File - Phase 3B Recovery Performance Impact Demo
# ============================================================================
# Used by: RecoveryPerformanceImpactDemo.java
# Purpose: Demonstrate performance characteristics of recovery operations and
#          show how Phase 3B recovery metrics help analyze performance impact
# Features: Recovery metrics collection, performance comparison, different
#           recovery strategies (default-value, service-based)
