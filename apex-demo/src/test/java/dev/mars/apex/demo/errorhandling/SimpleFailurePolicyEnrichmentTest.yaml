# APEX FAILURE POLICY DEMONSTRATION: ENRICHMENT POLICY TEST REGISTRY
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This is a scenario registry file that demonstrates enrichment stage behavior
# under different failure policies. It tests how APEX handles enrichment processing
# when previous stages fail and how enrichment stages handle missing or invalid data.
#
# ENRICHMENT FAILURE POLICY BEHAVIOR:
# 1. Validation stage fails due to missing required fields
# 2. APEX applies "continue-with-warnings" policy
# 3. Processing continues to enrichment stage
# 4. Enrichment stage executes calculations and field mappings
# 5. Enrichment results are captured despite validation failures
# 6. ScenarioExecutionResult shows both validation warnings and enrichment results
