/**
 * ValidationFailureScenarioTest - Comprehensive Negative Testing for APEX Validation Rules
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * This test class demonstrates how APEX handles validation rule failures and negative test cases
 * in stage-based scenario processing. It validates that the APEX rules engine can properly
 * detect, report, and handle business rule violations while maintaining system stability.
 * 
 * TESTING APPROACH:
 * - Uses validation rules designed to trigger on typical trade data that violates business requirements
 * - Tests both ERROR and WARNING severity validation rules
 * - Demonstrates how APEX validation rules are informational rather than blocking by design
 * - Validates that processing can continue even when validation rules detect issues
 * - Shows proper error reporting and logging for validation failures
 * 
 * BUSINESS CONTEXT:
 * In real financial trading systems, validation rules often need to detect and report issues
 * without stopping processing entirely. This allows for:
 * - Audit trails of validation concerns
 * - Downstream systems to make decisions about how to handle flagged trades
 * - Regulatory reporting of trades that don't meet certain criteria
 * - Risk management alerts while maintaining operational flow
 * 
 * APEX DESIGN PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED:
 * 1. Validation rules trigger (return true) when they detect violations
 * 2. Triggered rules are reported as successful "matches" with appropriate severity
 * 3. Stage execution continues unless there are actual system errors
 * 4. Comprehensive execution results track both successful validations and rule triggers
 * 5. Failure policies control how stages respond to different types of issues
 * 
 * FILE STRUCTURE:
 * This test follows the established APEX demo pattern of co-locating YAML configuration
 * files with their corresponding test classes:
 * - ValidationFailureScenarioTest.java (this file)
 * - ValidationFailureScenarioTest.yaml (scenario registry)
 * - ValidationFailureScenarioTest-scenario.yaml (scenario definition)
 * - ValidationFailureScenarioTest-validation-rules.yaml (validation rules that trigger on violations)
 * - ValidationFailureScenarioTest-enrichment-rules.yaml (enrichment configuration)
 * 
 * EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
 * - Validation rules successfully trigger when they detect business rule violations
 * - Appropriate error messages are logged with ERROR/WARNING severity
 * - Stage execution completes successfully even when validation rules trigger
 * - Comprehensive execution results provide visibility into validation outcomes
 * - Demonstrates that APEX validation is designed for reporting rather than blocking
