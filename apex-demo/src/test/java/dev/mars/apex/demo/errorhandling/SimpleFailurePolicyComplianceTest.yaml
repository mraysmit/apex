# APEX FAILURE POLICY DEMONSTRATION: COMPLIANCE POLICY TEST REGISTRY
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This is a scenario registry file that demonstrates compliance rule execution
# after previous stage failures. It tests how APEX handles compliance processing
# when earlier stages (like validation) fail but compliance rules should still execute.
#
# COMPLIANCE FAILURE POLICY BEHAVIOR:
# 1. Validation stage fails due to missing required fields
# 2. APEX applies "continue-with-warnings" policy
# 3. Processing continues to compliance stage
# 4. Compliance rules execute despite validation failure
# 5. Compliance results are captured and processed
# 6. ScenarioExecutionResult shows both validation warnings and compliance results
