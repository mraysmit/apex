# Conditional Expression Lookup Example Configuration
# Demonstrates conditional expression evaluation in lookup-key
# Use Case: Risk-based loan assessment with conditional credit score categorization

# ============================================================================
# APEX YAML Configuration File
# ============================================================================
# Used by: ConditionalExpressionLookupTest.java (Active test implementation)
# Purpose: Conditional expression lookup demonstration using APEX lookup
#          enrichments with conditional logic, expression-based lookups, and
#          dynamic lookup conditions for complex business scenarios
# Status: ACTIVE - Integrated with conditional expression lookup tests
