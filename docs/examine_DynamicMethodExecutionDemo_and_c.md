# Why DynamicMethodExecutionDemo Has No Implementation

After examining the codebase, I found that `DynamicMethodExecutionDemo.java` is essentially an empty shell class with no actual implementation of the features it's supposed to demonstrate. Here's why:

## Current State of DynamicMethodExecutionDemo

The class contains:
- A constructor that accepts an `ExpressionEvaluatorService`
- Two method stubs:
  - `demonstrateDynamicMethodExecution(PricingServiceDemo pricingService)`
  - `demonstrateDynamicLookupService()`

Both methods only contain print statements and comments where the actual implementation code should be:

```java
public void demonstrateDynamicMethodExecution(providers.service.dev.mars.rulesengine.demo.PricingServiceDemo pricingService) {
    System.out.println("\n=== Demonstrating Dynamic Method Execution ===");
    // Dynamic method execution demonstration code
}
```

## The Actual Implementation Exists Elsewhere

The functionality that `DynamicMethodExecutionDemo` is supposed to demonstrate is already fully implemented in `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo.java`:

1. **Dynamic Method Execution**: Implemented in `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo.demonstrateDynamicMethodExecution()` (lines 152-171)
   - This method demonstrates how to use SpEL to dynamically call methods on a service based on a strategy name
   - It creates expressions like `#pricingService.calculateStandardPrice(#basePrice)` at runtime

2. **Dynamic Lookup Service**: Implemented in `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo.demonstrateDynamicLookupService()` (lines 288-329)
   - This method demonstrates how to use SpEL to dynamically find a lookup service by name and use it for validation

## Why It's Not Implemented

The most likely reasons for the lack of implementation in `DynamicMethodExecutionDemo`:

1. **Redundancy**: The functionality is already implemented in `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo`, which is a more comprehensive demo class that showcases multiple SpEL features.

2. **Abandoned Development**: It may have been created as a standalone demo but was abandoned in favor of the more comprehensive `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo`.

3. **No Integration**: The class is not referenced or used anywhere else in the project, and it has no main method to run it independently.

## Recommendation

If you need to demonstrate dynamic method execution features, you should:

1. Use the existing implementation in `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo`, which is already complete and functional
2. Either remove `DynamicMethodExecutionDemo` or implement it by copying the relevant code from `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo`

The `SpelAdvancedFeaturesDemo` class already provides a complete demonstration of these features and is properly integrated with the rest of the application through its main method.
