I've created a fully functional version of the `executeRule` method that can execute a single Rule against provided facts. This method:

1. Takes a single Rule object and a map of facts as parameters
2. Checks if the rule is null and returns an appropriate result if it is
3. Creates an evaluation context using the existing `createContext` method
4. Evaluates the rule's condition using the SpEL parser
5. Returns a RuleResult.match if the rule condition evaluates to true
6. Returns a RuleResult.error if an exception occurs during evaluation
7. Returns a RuleResult.noMatch if the rule condition evaluates to false

This method follows the same pattern as the existing `executeRulesList` method but is optimized for a single Rule. It provides proper logging and error handling, and returns appropriate RuleResult objects based on the evaluation outcome.

The implementation maintains the same design and style as the existing code, following SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns. It also maintains the same level of error handling and logging as the existing methods in the RulesEngine class.
