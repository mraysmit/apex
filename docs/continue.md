# Service Package Reorganization Proposal

Based on my analysis of the `com.rulesengine.core.service` package, I recommend reorganizing it into more specific subpackages to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability. The current structure has 20 service classes and interfaces all in a single package, which makes it difficult to understand the relationships between them.

## Current Issues

1. The service package is too large with 20 different files
2. Related services are not grouped together
3. There's inconsistency in test organization (e.g., `RuleEngineServiceTest` is in the engine package, but `RuleEngineService` is in the service package)
4. Not all services have corresponding test files

## Proposed Package Structure

I recommend reorganizing the services into the following subpackages:

### 1. `com.rulesengine.core.service.data`
For data source and data management services:
- `CustomDataSource.java`
- `DataServiceManager.java`
- `DataSource.java` (interface)
- `DataSourceFactory.java` (interface)

### 2. `com.rulesengine.core.service.lookup`
For lookup and registry services:
- `LookupService.java`
- `LookupServiceRegistry.java`
- `IDataLookup.java` (interface)
- `CompositeLookup.java`
- `RecordMatcher.java` (interface)

### 3. `com.rulesengine.core.service.transform`
For transformation and enrichment services:
- `Transformer.java` (interface)
- `TransformationService.java`
- `Enricher.java` (interface)
- `EnrichmentService.java`

### 4. `com.rulesengine.core.service.validation`
For validation services:
- `Validator.java` (interface)
- `ValidationService.java`

### 5. `com.rulesengine.core.service.engine`
For rule engine and expression evaluation services:
- `RuleEngineService.java`
- `RuleConfigurationService.java`
- `ExpressionEvaluatorService.java`
- `TemplateProcessorService.java`

### 6. `com.rulesengine.core.service.common`
For common interfaces and utilities:
- `NamedService.java` (interface)

## Benefits of This Reorganization

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Related services are grouped together, making the codebase more intuitive to navigate.
2. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one aspect of the system (e.g., data sources) will be localized to a specific package.
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Developers can quickly understand the purpose of a service based on its package.
4. **Clearer Dependencies**: Package dependencies become more explicit, helping to prevent circular dependencies.
5. **Easier Testing**: Test classes can be organized to mirror the package structure.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the new package directories
2. Move each service class/interface to its appropriate package
3. Update import statements in all affected files
4. Reorganize test classes to match the new package structure
5. Ensure all services have corresponding test classes
6. Update any documentation to reflect the new package structure

This reorganization will significantly improve the architecture of the rules engine core module while maintaining all existing functionality.
