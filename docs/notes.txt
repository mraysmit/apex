create a new version of the TradeValidatorDemo called DynamicTradeValidatorDemo. This new version will implement the same validation rules but it will not implement or use the Validator<T> class. Instead it will use the dynamic evaluation capabilities of the rules engine. Examples of dynamic behaviour are present in the project, for example DynamicMethodExecutionTest. The claases of Rule, RuleGroup and RuleResult should of course be used.







1. Service Layer - Missing Tests
ValidationService - No dedicated test file (only used in demo tests)
LookupServiceRegistry - No test coverage
GenericTransformerService - No test coverage
EnrichmentService - No test coverage
DataTypeScenarioService - No test coverage

2. Engine Executor Layer - No Coverage
RuleChainExecutor - Complex rule chaining logic untested
Pattern-specific executors (6 different patterns):
ConditionalChainingExecutor
SequentialDependencyExecutor
ResultBasedRoutingExecutor
AccumulativeChainingExecutor
ComplexWorkflowExecutor
FluentBuilderExecutor

3. Configuration Layer - Minimal Coverage
YamlConfigurationLoader - No test coverage
YamlRuleConfiguration - No test coverage
YamlRuleChain - No test coverage
Data source configuration classes - No test coverage

4. Exception Handling - No Coverage
RuleEngineException - No test coverage
RuleEvaluationException - No test coverage
Error recovery services - No test coverage

5. API Layer - Partial Coverage
RulesService - No dedicated test file (instance-based service)
