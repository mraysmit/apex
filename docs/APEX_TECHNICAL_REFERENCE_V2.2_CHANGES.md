# APEX Technical Reference v2.2 - Change Log

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Previous Version:** 2.1 (2025-09-06)  
**Current Version:** 2.2 (2025-10-09)  
**Status:** Accuracy-Verified - Hallucinated properties removed

---

## Summary of Changes

Version 2.2 is an **accuracy correction release** that removes hallucinated YAML properties and clarifies the cache configuration hierarchy. No functional changes to APEX itself - only documentation corrections.

---

## Critical Corrections

### 1. Removed Hallucinated Properties

The following properties were documented but **do not exist** in the APEX implementation:

#### ‚ùå Removed from Lookup-Dataset Level:
- `preload-enabled` - This is a **data-source level** property only
- `cache-max-size` - This is a **data-source level** property only
- `cache-refresh-ahead` - Wrong name; actual property is `refresh-ahead` at **data-source level**
- `performance-monitoring` - Does not exist in any implementation
- `log-cache-stats` - Does not exist in any implementation
- `time-based` - Planned feature, not implemented
- `effective-date-field` - Planned feature, not implemented

### 2. Clarified Cache Configuration Hierarchy

**Added comprehensive explanation** of the two-level cache configuration system:

#### Lookup-Dataset Level (LIMITED - Only 2 properties):
```yaml
lookup-dataset:
  cache-enabled: true        # ‚úÖ ONLY these two properties
  cache-ttl-seconds: 3600    # ‚úÖ are available at this level
```

#### Data-Source Level (FULL FEATURES):
```yaml
data-sources:
  - name: "my-source"
    cache:
      enabled: true
      ttlSeconds: 3600
      maxSize: 10000              # ‚úÖ Data-source level only
      preload-enabled: true       # ‚úÖ Data-source level only
      refresh-ahead: true         # ‚úÖ Data-source level only (note: NOT "cache-refresh-ahead")
      statistics-enabled: true    # ‚úÖ Data-source level only
```

### 3. Added Implementation Status Markers

All code examples now include markers:
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED** - Feature is verified as working
- **‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED** - Feature is planned but not available
- **‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL** - Feature exists but may change

## Properties Verification Summary

### ‚úÖ Verified CORRECT (Lookup-Dataset Level):
- `type` - Dataset type (inline, yaml-file, csv-file, database, rest-api)
- `file-path` - Path to file-based datasets
- `key-field` - Field to use as lookup key
- `data` - Inline dataset data
- `default-values` - Default values for missing fields
- `cache-enabled` - Enable/disable caching
- `cache-ttl-seconds` - Cache time-to-live
- `format-config` - File format configuration
- `connection-name` - Data source reference
- `data-source-ref` - External data source reference
- `query` - SQL query
- `query-ref` - Named query reference
- `parameters` - Query parameters
- `endpoint` - REST API endpoint
- `operation-ref` - REST API operation reference

### ‚ùå Verified INCORRECT (Were Documented, Don't Exist):
- `preload-enabled` - Data-source level only
- `cache-max-size` - Data-source level only
- `cache-refresh-ahead` - Wrong name; should be `refresh-ahead` at data-source level
- `performance-monitoring` - Does not exist
- `log-cache-stats` - Does not exist
- `time-based` - Not implemented
- `effective-date-field` - Not implemented

### ‚úÖ Verified CORRECT (Data-Source Level):
- `enabled` - Enable/disable cache
- `ttlSeconds` - Time-to-live
- `maxSize` - Maximum cache entries
- `maxIdleSeconds` - Maximum idle time
- `preload-enabled` - Preload on startup
- `refresh-ahead` - Refresh before expiration
- `refresh-ahead-factor` - Refresh timing factor
- `statistics-enabled` - Enable statistics
- `key-prefix` - Cache key prefix
- `compression-enabled` - Enable compression

## Validation Methodology

All corrections were verified against:

1. **Source Code Analysis:**
   - `YamlEnrichment.java` - LookupDataset class `@JsonProperty` annotations
   - `YamlDataSource.java` - Cache configuration properties
   - Verified lines 454-458 for lookup-dataset cache properties
   - Verified lines 521-526 for data-source cache properties

2. **Test File Analysis:**
   - Searched all YAML files in `apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/`
   - Zero usage found for hallucinated properties
   - Confirmed correct usage patterns for implemented properties

3. **Cross-Reference:**
   - Compared against APEX_YAML_REFERENCE.md
   - Compared against APEX_CONDITIONAL_PROCESSING_GUIDE.md
   - Ensured consistency across all documentation

---

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact Changes:
1. **Time-Based Dataset Configuration** - Marked as NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - Users expecting this feature will now know it doesn't exist
   - Workaround provided using conditional enrichments

2. **Cache Configuration Hierarchy** - Clarified
   - Users will now configure caching correctly
   - Prevents confusion about where properties belong

### Medium Impact Changes:
1. **Performance Monitoring Properties** - Removed
   - Users won't try to use non-existent monitoring features
   - Clear that statistics are at data-source level only

### Low Impact Changes:
1. **Implementation Status Markers** - Added
   - Improves user confidence in documented features
   - Clear distinction between implemented and planned

---

## Recommendations for Users

### If You Were Using Hallucinated Properties:

1. **`preload-enabled` at lookup-dataset level:**
   - Move to data-source level cache configuration
   - See Section: "Cache Configuration Hierarchy"

2. **`cache-refresh-ahead`:**
   - Use `refresh-ahead` at data-source level instead
   - Note the correct property name

3. **`time-based` and `effective-date-field`:**
   - Implement using conditional enrichments
   - See workaround in Section: "Time-Based Dataset Configuration"

4. **`performance-monitoring` and `log-cache-stats`:**
   - Use `statistics-enabled` at data-source level
   - Monitor through APEX logging framework

---

## Future Enhancements

The following features were documented but not implemented. They may be added in future versions:

1. **Time-Based Dataset Lookups** - Automatic effective-date-based lookups
2. **Lookup-Level Performance Monitoring** - Granular monitoring per lookup
3. **Advanced Cache Statistics** - Detailed cache performance metrics
