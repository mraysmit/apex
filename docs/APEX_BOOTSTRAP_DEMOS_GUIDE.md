## Integration with REST API

All bootstrap demos integrate seamlessly with the APEX REST API, providing practical examples of:

### API Usage Patterns
- Rule evaluation via HTTP endpoints
- Configuration management through API calls
- Performance monitoring through actuator endpoints
- Interactive testing through Swagger UI

### Starting the REST API
```bash
# Start the API server
cd apex-rest-api
mvn spring-boot:run

# Access interactive documentation
open http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
```

### API Integration Examples
Each bootstrap demo shows how to:
- Submit rule evaluation requests via REST API
- Load and validate YAML configurations through API endpoints
- Monitor performance metrics through actuator endpoints
- Handle errors and exceptions in API responses

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Database Connection Issues (Bootstrap Demos Only)
**Problem**: PostgreSQL connection failures
**Solution**: Bootstrap demos automatically fall back to in-memory H2 database
**Verification**: Check startup logs for database connection status
**Note**: Lookup examples do not require database connections

#### Memory Issues
**Problem**: OutOfMemoryError during execution
**Solution**: Increase JVM heap size: `-Xmx4g -Xms2g`
**Prevention**: Ensure minimum 4GB RAM available
**Lookup Examples**: Generally require less memory than bootstrap demos

#### Configuration Loading Issues
**Problem**: YAML configuration validation errors
**Solution**: Check file paths and YAML syntax
**Verification**: Enable debug logging for detailed error messages
**Lookup Examples**: Configurations are loaded from classpath resources

#### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Processing times exceed expected performance
**Solution**: Check system resources and JVM performance
**Bootstrap Demos**: Target sub-100ms processing times
**Lookup Examples**: Focus on pattern demonstration rather than performance

#### Lookup Pattern Issues
**Problem**: Lookup enrichment not working as expected
**Solution**: Verify lookup key evaluation and dataset matching
**Debugging**: Enable detailed logging to see lookup key values
**Validation**: Check that test data matches expected lookup key patterns
