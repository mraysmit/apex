create a new version of the TradeValidatorDemo called DynamicTradeValidatorDemo. This new version will implement the same validation rules but it will not implement or use the Validator<T> class. Instead it will use the dynamic evaluation capabilities of the rules engine. Examples of dynamic behaviour are present in the project, for example DynamicMethodExecutionTest. The claases of Rule, RuleGroup and RuleResult should of course be used.





I'll help you check the test coverage for data services and data lookup features. Let me first gather information about the data services and their YAML configurations, then examine the existing tests.

Now let me look for YAML configuration files and their structure:

Now let me examine the existing tests for data services:

Now let me look at the specific YAML example files to understand the data lookup configurations:

Now let me check what tests currently exist for the data lookup functionality:

Let me examine some key test files to understand the current test coverage:

Now let me run the existing tests to see what's currently working:

Let me check what specific tests exist for YAML data source functionality:

Let me run a more specific test to see what's working:

Let me check the demo tests to see what data lookup functionality is being tested:

Now let me create a comprehensive plan for testing data services and data lookup features. Based on my analysis, I can see there are several areas that need better test coverage:

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's my comprehensive plan for validating the functionality of data services and data lookup features:

## Current Test Coverage Analysis

I've identified several areas where test coverage for data services and data lookup functionality can be improved:

### **Existing Test Coverage (Good)**
- ✅ **Basic DataSource implementations** - CustomDataSourceTest (32 tests)
- ✅ **LookupServiceRegistry** - LookupServiceRegistryTest (comprehensive)
- ✅ **YamlDataSource configuration** - YamlDataSourceTest (extensive Map-based config tests)
- ✅ **External data source integration** - ExternalDataSourceIntegrationTest (8 tests)
- ✅ **Demo data services** - DataServiceManagerTest, MockDataSourceTest

### **Test Coverage Gaps (Need Improvement)**
- ❌ **YAML-to-runtime data lookup integration** - Limited end-to-end testing
- ❌ **Multi-data source lookup scenarios** - No comprehensive failover testing
- ❌ **Data enrichment workflows** - Missing complex lookup chain testing
- ❌ **Performance under load** - No performance benchmarks for lookup operations
- ❌ **Error handling in lookup chains** - Limited error scenario coverage

## Proposed Test Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: YAML Data Lookup Integration Tests**
Create tests that validate YAML configurations translate correctly to working data lookup functionality:
- Database query execution from YAML configs
- File-based lookup operations (CSV, JSON)
- Cache-based lookup with TTL and eviction
- REST API lookup with authentication
- Parameter binding and query execution

### **Phase 2: Data Service Manager Lookup Tests**
Build comprehensive tests for DataServiceManager lookup operations:
- Multi-source lookup with prioritization
- Failover scenarios when primary sources fail
- Data source health monitoring during lookups
- Concurrent lookup operations
- Memory and resource management

### **Phase 3: End-to-End Scenario Tests**
Develop real-world scenario tests using the YAML examples:
- User enrichment workflows (cache → database → API)
- Session management with cache fallback
- Configuration-driven data processing
- Multi-step data transformation pipelines

### **Phase 4: Performance and Error Handling**
Create robust tests for production scenarios:
- Load testing with concurrent lookups
- Memory usage under high volume
- Network failure simulation
- Invalid configuration handling
- Data source unavailability scenarios

## Key Test Areas to Focus On

1. **YAML Configuration Validation**
    - Verify all YAML data source types can be loaded and executed
    - Test parameter binding and query execution
    - Validate connection pooling and caching configurations

2. **Data Lookup Chain Testing**
    - Test complex lookup scenarios from the mixed-example.yaml
    - Validate cache-first, database-fallback patterns
    - Test data enrichment from multiple sources

3. **Integration with Lookup Services**
    - Test LookupServiceRegistry with YAML-configured services
    - Validate lookup service discovery and execution
    - Test lookup service chaining and composition

4. **Error Handling and Resilience**
    - Test circuit breaker patterns
    - Validate retry logic and timeout handling
    - Test graceful degradation when sources are unavailable

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these tests? I recommend starting with **Phase 1 (YAML Data Lookup Integration Tests)** as it will provide the foundation for validating that your YAML configurations work correctly with the actual data lookup functionality.


5. API Layer - Partial Coverage
RulesService - No dedicated test file (instance-based service)
