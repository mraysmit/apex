## Implemented Architecture

### Pipeline Orchestration Architecture

```
YAML Pipeline → Pipeline Executor → Step Execution → Data Flow
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
Pipeline Config → Dependency Resolution → Extract Step → Data Context
Step Definitions → Validation → Transform Step → Processed Data
Error Handling → Execution → Load Step → Target Sinks
Monitoring → Results → Audit Step → Compliance Logs
```

### Implemented Components

#### 1. DataSink Interface (Implemented)

```java
public interface DataSink {
    void write(String operation, Object data) throws DataSinkException;
    void initialize(DataSinkConfiguration config) throws DataSinkException;
    void shutdown();
    boolean isHealthy();
    DataSinkMetrics getMetrics();
}
```

#### 2. PipelineExecutor (Implemented)

```java
public class PipelineExecutor {
    public YamlPipelineExecutionResult execute(PipelineConfiguration pipeline);
    private void executeStep(PipelineStep step, YamlPipelineExecutionResult result);
    private void validatePipeline(PipelineConfiguration pipeline);
    private List<PipelineStep> topologicalSort(List<PipelineStep> steps);
}
```

#### 3. Pipeline Configuration Classes (Implemented)

```java
public class PipelineConfiguration {
    private String name;
    private List<PipelineStep> steps;
    private ExecutionConfiguration execution;
    private MonitoringConfiguration monitoring;
}

public class PipelineStep {
    private String name;
    private String type; // extract, load, transform, audit
    private String source; // for extract steps
    private String sink; // for load/audit steps
    private String operation;
    private List<String> dependsOn;
    private boolean optional;
}
```
