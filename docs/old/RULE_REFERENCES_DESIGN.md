# APEX Rule References - Comprehensive Design Guide

## üö® **THE FUNDAMENTAL APEX ARCHITECTURE**

**THIS IS NOT AN ADVANCED FEATURE - THIS IS HOW APEX WORKS**

### **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL REALITY**

**99% of production APEX systems are built this way:**
- **Rules** are defined in **completely separate YAML files** from **Rule Groups**
- **Rule Groups** reference rules by ID across file boundaries
- **Multi-file loading** is the **STANDARD PRODUCTION PATTERN**
- **Rule reusability** is the **PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION** of APEX

**This is not optional. This is not a convenience feature. This IS the APEX architecture.**

## üèóÔ∏è **THE CORE APEX DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: SEPARATION = REUSABILITY**

### **FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH**: Rules and Rule Groups are **ALWAYS SEPARATE** in Production

**ABSOLUTE CRITICALITY**: In production APEX systems, Rules and Rule Groups are **defined in separate YAML files in 99% of implementations**. This is not just a design choice‚Äîit's the **FOUNDATIONAL ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE** that makes APEX a powerful enterprise rules engine:

### **üéØ THE PRIMARY BUSINESS VALUE: MASSIVE RULE REUSABILITY**

**ONE RULE ‚Üí MANY RULE GROUPS ‚Üí INFINITE SCENARIOS**

- **Single Rule Definition**: A rule like "age-validation" is written **ONCE** and used by **DOZENS** of rule groups
- **Cross-Scenario Reuse**: The same rule serves customer onboarding, loan processing, insurance applications, account opening
- **Enterprise Scale**: One "credit-score-check" rule might be used in 50+ different business contexts
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Update the rule once, it automatically updates across ALL scenarios using it

### **üè¢ PRODUCTION REALITY: This is How Enterprise APEX Works**

**TYPICAL ENTERPRISE APEX DEPLOYMENT:**
```
enterprise-rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ customer-validation-rules.yaml     # 25 reusable customer rules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ financial-validation-rules.yaml    # 30 reusable financial rules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compliance-rules.yaml              # 40 reusable compliance rules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ business-logic-rules.yaml          # 35 reusable business rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rule-groups/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ onboarding-groups.yaml             # References rules from ALL rule files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loan-processing-groups.yaml        # References rules from ALL rule files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compliance-groups.yaml             # References rules from ALL rule files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ risk-assessment-groups.yaml        # References rules from ALL rule files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scenarios/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ customer-onboarding.yaml           # References rule groups
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mortgage-processing.yaml           # References rule groups
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ regulatory-reporting.yaml          # References rule groups
```

**RESULT**: 130 rules ‚Üí 200+ rule groups ‚Üí 1000+ business scenarios

### **üî• WHY SEPARATION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL**

1. **TEAM COLLABORATION**:
   - Rules team owns business logic
   - Process team owns rule groups
   - Business team owns scenarios
   - **NO CONFLICTS, NO BOTTLENECKS**

2. **CHANGE MANAGEMENT**:
   - Update one rule ‚Üí Automatically affects all consuming rule groups
   - Add new rule group ‚Üí Reuses existing proven rules
   - New business scenario ‚Üí Combines existing rule groups
   - **ZERO DUPLICATION, MAXIMUM AGILITY**

3. **ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE**:
   - Rules are **CENTRALLY MANAGED** and **CONSISTENTLY APPLIED**
   - Compliance rules are **IDENTICAL** across all business processes
   - Audit trail shows **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for each business rule
   - **REGULATORY COMPLIANCE THROUGH ARCHITECTURE**

## üìã **THE STANDARD APEX PATTERN: SeparateFilesRuleGroupProcessingTest**

### **This Simple Test Shows THE FUNDAMENTAL APEX ARCHITECTURE**

```java
// RULES FILE - Contains reusable business logic
String rulesYaml = """
    metadata:
      name: "Customer Rules"
      version: "1.0.0"

    rules:
      - id: "age-check"                    # ‚Üê REUSABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE RULE GROUPS
        name: "Age Validation"
        condition: "#age >= 18"
        message: "Customer must be 18 or older"
        severity: "ERROR"
      - id: "email-validation"             # ‚Üê REUSABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE RULE GROUPS
        name: "Email Validation"
        condition: "#email != null && #email.contains('@')"
        message: "Valid email required"
        severity: "ERROR"
    """;

// RULE GROUPS FILE - References rules from separate file
String ruleGroupsYaml = """
    metadata:
      name: "Customer Validation Groups"
      version: "1.0.0"

    rule-groups:
      - id: "customer-validation"
        name: "Customer Validation Group"
        operator: "AND"
        rule-ids:
          - "age-check"        # ‚Üê REFERENCES rule from different file
          - "email-validation" # ‚Üê REFERENCES rule from different file
    """;

// APEX AUTOMATICALLY MERGES THEM - This is the magic
RulesEngine engine = rulesEngineService.createRulesEngineFromMultipleFiles(
    rulesFile.toString(),      // Rules file
    ruleGroupsFile.toString()  // Rule groups file
);
```

**THIS IS NOT AN ADVANCED FEATURE - THIS IS BASIC APEX OPERATION**

## Rule Reference Approaches

APEX Rules Engine supports two complementary approaches for referencing rules in rule groups (both work seamlessly with the fundamental separation architecture):

### 1. Simple Approach: `rule-ids`
- **Format**: Simple string array
- **Use Case**: Basic rule grouping with default execution order
- **Performance**: Minimal memory overhead, fastest processing
- **Configuration**: Minimal setup required

### 2. Advanced Approach: `rule-references`
- **Format**: Complex object array with fine-grained control
- **Use Case**: Custom execution sequence, individual enable/disable, priority overrides
- **Performance**: Slightly higher memory usage, maximum flexibility
- **Configuration**: Rich control options available

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | `rule-ids` | `rule-references` | Status |
|---------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Basic Processing** | ‚úÖ Simple string array | ‚úÖ Complex object array | **COMPLETE** |
| **External File References** | ‚úÖ Cross-file rule resolution | ‚úÖ Cross-file rule resolution | **COMPLETE** |
| **Multi-File Configuration** | ‚úÖ Automatic merging | ‚úÖ Automatic merging | **COMPLETE** |
| **Execution Sequence** | ‚úÖ Auto (1, 2, 3...) | ‚úÖ Custom `sequence` property | **COMPLETE** |
| **Enable/Disable** | ‚úÖ All rules enabled | ‚úÖ Individual `enabled` property | **COMPLETE** |
| **Priority Override** | ‚úÖ Uses rule's priority | ‚úÖ `override-priority` property | **COMPLETE** |

## External File Reference Design

### Core Components

#### 1. YamlRuleRef Class
**Purpose**: Define references to external rule files following the proven external data source pattern.

```java
/**
 * YAML configuration class for external rule file references.
 * Enables separation of rule definitions across multiple files.
 */
public class YamlRuleRef {
    @JsonProperty("name")
    private String name;

    @JsonProperty("source")
    private String source;

    @JsonProperty("enabled")
    private Boolean enabled;

    @JsonProperty("description")
    private String description;
}
```

#### 2. Configuration Enhancement
**Purpose**: Add rule-refs field to main configuration using the same pattern as data-source-refs.

```java
// Enhanced YamlRuleConfiguration
@JsonProperty("rule-refs")
private List<YamlRuleRef> ruleRefs;
```

#### 3. Processing Flow
**Purpose**: Load and merge referenced rule files before validation.

```
Processing Sequence:
1. Parse YAML ‚Üí YamlRuleConfiguration
2. processRuleReferences(config)        // Load and merge rule files
3. processDataSourceReferences(config)  // Load and merge data sources
4. validateConfiguration(config)        // Validate complete merged config
```

### File System and Classpath Support

#### Flexible Source Resolution
- **File System**: Absolute and relative paths
- **Classpath**: Resource loading from JAR files
- **Fallback Logic**: Try file system first, then classpath

#### Loading Mechanisms
- **Single File Loading**: Processes external references automatically
- **Multi-File Loading**: Enhanced `createRulesEngineFromMultipleFiles()` method
- **Configuration Merging**: Creates unified rule registry across all files

## YAML Syntax Design

### Main Configuration File
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Main Configuration"
  version: "1.0.0"

# Reference external rule files
rule-refs:
  - name: "customer-rules"
    source: "rules/customer-rules.yaml"
    enabled: true
    description: "Customer validation rules"
  - name: "financial-rules"
    source: "rules/financial-rules.yaml"
    enabled: true
    description: "Financial processing rules"

# Rule groups can reference rules from any file
rule-groups:
  - id: "customer-validation"
    name: "Customer Validation Group"
    rule-ids:
      - "age-check"        # From customer-rules.yaml
      - "email-validation"  # From customer-rules.yaml
      - "credit-check"      # From financial-rules.yaml
```

### Referenced Rule File
```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Customer Rules"
  version: "1.0.0"

rules:
  - id: "age-check"
    name: "Age Validation"
    condition: "#age >= 18"
    message: "Customer must be 18 or older"
  - id: "email-validation"
    name: "Email Validation"
    condition: "#email != null && #email.contains('@')"
    message: "Valid email required"
```

### Simple Rule References
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "simple-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-ids: ["rule1", "rule2", "rule3"]
```

### Advanced Rule References
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "advanced-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "rule3"
        sequence: 1              # Execute first
        enabled: true
      - rule-id: "rule1"
        sequence: 2              # Execute second
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 10    # Override default priority
      - rule-id: "rule2"
        sequence: 3              # Execute third
        enabled: false           # Skip this rule
```

## Enterprise Architecture Patterns

```

### Hierarchical Rule Group References
```yaml
# Rule groups can reference other rule groups
rule-groups:
  - id: "comprehensive-eligibility"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-group-references:        # References to other rule groups
      - "customer-validation"     # From customer-validation.yaml
      - "financial-validation"    # From financial-validation.yaml
      - "compliance-checks"       # From compliance-checks.yaml
```

## üèóÔ∏è **HIERARCHICAL RULE GROUP REFERENCES - COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3-Level Hierarchical Architecture**

APEX supports sophisticated hierarchical rule group composition where rule groups can reference other rule groups, creating a powerful 3-level hierarchy:

1. **Level 1: Individual Rules** (`base-rules.yaml`) - Atomic business logic
2. **Level 2: Base Rule Groups** (`base-groups.yaml`) - Reference individual rules
3. **Level 3: Composite Rule Groups** (`composite-groups.yaml`) - Reference other rule groups

### **Production Test Implementation**

#### **HierarchicalRuleGroupTest.java**
Comprehensive test demonstrating hierarchical rule group composition:

```java
/**
 * Hierarchical Rule Group References Tests.
 *
 * Demonstrates APEX's hierarchical rule group composition capability where rule groups
 * can reference other rule groups, creating a 3-level hierarchy:
 * 1. Individual Rules (base-rules.yaml)
 * 2. Base Rule Groups (base-groups.yaml) - reference individual rules
 * 3. Composite Rule Groups (composite-groups.yaml) - reference base rule groups
 */
@ExtendWith(ColoredTestOutputExtension.class)
@DisplayName("Hierarchical Rule Group References Tests")
public class HierarchicalRuleGroupTest {

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Complete Customer Onboarding - 3-Level Hierarchy")
    void testCompleteCustomerOnboarding() throws Exception {
        // Load the hierarchical configuration files

            "src/test/resources/rulegroups/hierarchical/base-groups.yaml",
            "src/test/resources/rulegroups/hierarchical/composite-groups.yaml"
        );

        // Execute composite rule group that references other rule groups
        RuleGroup completeOnboarding = engine.getConfiguration()
            .getRuleGroupById("complete-onboarding");

        // Test with customer data
        Map<String, Object> customerData = createValidCustomerData();

### **Key Features Demonstrated by Tests**

#### **1. Hierarchical Rule Group References**
- **Feature**: Rule groups can reference other rule groups using `rule-group-references`
- **Implementation**: `composite-groups.yaml` references rule groups from `base-groups.yaml`
- **Test Coverage**: `HierarchicalRuleGroupTest.java` validates 3-level hierarchy execution
- **Business Value**: Enables complex validation workflows with reusable components

#### **2. Mixed References**
- **Feature**: Rule groups can combine both `rule-group-references` and `rule-ids`
- **Implementation**: Single rule group references other groups AND individual rules
- **Test Coverage**: `mixed-validation` rule group in composite configuration
- **Business Value**: Maximum flexibility in rule composition

#### **3. Cross-File References**
- **Feature**: Rules and rule groups can be defined in separate files and referenced
- **Implementation**: `rule-refs` section enables external file loading
- **Test Coverage**: `SingleFileRuleReferenceIntegrationTest` and `MultiFileRuleReferenceIntegrationTest`
- **Business Value**: Modular configuration management and team collaboration

#### **4. Sequence Control**
- **Feature**: Rules within groups can have custom execution order using `sequence` property
- **Implementation**: `rule-references` with explicit sequence numbers
- **Test Coverage**: `RuleReferencesSequenceEnabledTest.testCustomSequenceOrder()`
- **Business Value**: Precise control over rule evaluation order

#### **5. Enable/Disable Control**
- **Feature**: Individual rule references can be enabled or disabled using `enabled` property
- **Implementation**: `rule-references` with `enabled: true/false`
- **Test Coverage**: `RuleReferencesSequenceEnabledTest.testOrOperatorWithEnabledDisabledRules()`
- **Business Value**: Dynamic rule activation without configuration changes

#### **6. Different Operators**
- **Feature**: Rule groups support AND/OR logic for evaluation
- **Implementation**: `operator: "AND"` or `operator: "OR"` in rule group configuration
- **Test Coverage**: Multiple tests demonstrate both AND and OR logic
- **Business Value**: Flexible validation logic for different business scenarios

### **Architectural Benefits**

#### **üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Scalability**
- **Hierarchical Composition**: Build complex validation from simple components
- **Rule Reusability**: Same rules used across multiple rule groups and scenarios
- **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can own different layers of the hierarchy
- **Modular Maintenance**: Changes propagate automatically through the hierarchy

#### **üîß Configuration Flexibility**
- **Multi-File Organization**: Separate concerns across different configuration files
- **Cross-File References**: Rules and rule groups can reference across file boundaries
- **Mixed Composition**: Combine rule group references with individual rule references
- **Dynamic Control**: Enable/disable rules and control execution sequence

#### **‚ö° Performance Optimization**
- **Lazy Loading**: Rule copies only created when needed (e.g., priority overrides)
- **Efficient Merging**: Rules merged into existing collections without duplication
- **Optimized Lookup**: Fast cross-file rule resolution during execution
- **Scalable Architecture**: Performance scales linearly with configuration complexity

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Robust Error Handling**
- **Cross-File Validation**: All rule references validated after file merging
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific errors with file paths and reference names
- **Graceful Degradation**: Disabled references skipped without affecting other rules

## üìö **COMPLETE RULE GROUP VARIATIONS REFERENCE**

### **Rule Group Configuration Syntax - All Variations**

#### **Complete YAML Syntax Reference**
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "comprehensive-example"
    name: "Comprehensive Rule Group Example"
    description: "Shows all possible rule group configuration options"
    operator: "AND"  # or "OR"
    stop-on-first-failure: true  # or false
    priority: 10
    enabled: true  # or false

    # VARIATION 1: Simple Rule References (most common)
    rule-ids:
      - "rule1"
      - "rule2"
      - "rule3"

    # VARIATION 2: Advanced Rule References (fine-grained control)
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "rule1"
        sequence: 1
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 5
      - rule-id: "rule2"
        sequence: 2
        enabled: false  # Skip this rule
      - rule-id: "rule3"
        sequence: 3
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 15

    # VARIATION 3: Rule Group References (hierarchical)
    rule-group-references:
      - "base-validation-group"
      - "compliance-group"
      - "business-logic-group"

    # VARIATION 4: Mixed References (maximum flexibility)
    rule-group-references:
      - "standard-validation"  # Reference other rule groups
    rule-ids:
      - "special-rule"         # Add individual rules
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "custom-rule" # Add rules with custom settings
        sequence: 10
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 1
```

#### **Operator Behavior Matrix**

| Operator | Rule Group Refs | Individual Rules | Mixed Refs | Short-Circuit |
|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|---------------|
| **AND** | All groups must pass | All rules must pass | All components must pass | Stops on first failure |
| **OR** | Any group can pass | Any rule can pass | Any component can pass | Stops on first success |

#### **Hierarchy Behavior Examples**

**Example 1: AND Group with Rule Group References**
```yaml
# Parent group uses AND - ALL referenced groups must pass
- id: "complete-validation"
  operator: "AND"
  rule-group-references:
    - "customer-validation"  # Must pass
    - "financial-validation" # Must pass
    - "compliance-validation" # Must pass
```

**Example 2: OR Group with Mixed References**
```yaml
# Parent group uses OR - ANY component can pass
- id: "flexible-validation"
  operator: "OR"
  rule-group-references:
    - "premium-validation"   # Can pass
  rule-ids:
    - "bypass-rule"          # Can pass
  rule-references:
    - rule-id: "override-rule"
      enabled: true          # Can pass
```

### **Error Scenarios and Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Configuration Errors**

**1. Circular References**
```yaml
# X INVALID: Circular reference
rule-groups:
  - id: "group-a"
    rule-group-references: ["group-b"]
  - id: "group-b"
    rule-group-references: ["group-a"]  # Circular!
```
**Error**: `Circular rule group reference detected: group-a -> group-b -> group-a`

**2. Missing Rule Group References**
```yaml
# X INVALID: Referenced group doesn't exist
rule-groups:
  - id: "parent-group"
    rule-group-references: ["non-existent-group"]
```
**Error**: `Rule group reference not found: non-existent-group`

**3. Invalid Mixed References**
```yaml
# X INVALID: Cannot mix rule-ids with rule-references
rule-groups:
  - id: "invalid-group"
    rule-ids: ["rule1"]           # Simple format
    rule-references:              # Advanced format
      - rule-id: "rule2"          # Cannot mix both!
```
**Error**: `Cannot use both rule-ids and rule-references in the same group`

#### **Validation Rules**

1. **Rule Group References**: Must reference existing rule groups
2. **Circular References**: Not allowed at any level
3. **Mixed Syntax**: Cannot combine `rule-ids` with `rule-references`
4. **Sequence Numbers**: Must be unique within a rule group
5. **Priority Overrides**: Must be between 1-1000

### **Performance and Best Practices Guide**

#### **Performance Characteristics**

| Variation | Memory Usage | Processing Speed | Configuration Complexity |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Simple `rule-ids`** | Minimal | Fastest | Low |
| **Advanced `rule-references`** | Moderate | Fast | Medium |
| **Rule Group References** | Moderate | Fast | Medium |
| **Mixed References** | Higher | Moderate | High |

#### **When to Use Each Variation**

**Use Simple `rule-ids` when:**
- ‚úÖ Basic rule grouping is sufficient
- ‚úÖ Default execution order is acceptable
- ‚úÖ All rules should always be enabled
- ‚úÖ Performance is critical
- ‚úÖ Configuration simplicity is important

**Use Advanced `rule-references` when:**
- ‚úÖ Custom execution sequence is needed
- ‚úÖ Individual rule enable/disable control required
- ‚úÖ Priority overrides are necessary

**Use `rule-group-references` when:**
- ‚úÖ Building hierarchical validation workflows
- ‚úÖ Reusing existing rule groups
- ‚úÖ Creating composite business processes
- ‚úÖ Team collaboration across rule group ownership

**Use Mixed References when:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum flexibility is required
- ‚úÖ Combining standard groups with custom rules
- ‚úÖ Complex business scenarios with multiple validation paths
- ‚úÖ Gradual migration from simple to complex configurations

### **Troubleshooting Guide**

#### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue 1: Rule Group Reference Not Found**
```
Error: Rule group reference not found: customer-validation
```
**Solution:**
1. Check that the referenced rule group exists in the configuration
2. Verify the rule group ID spelling
3. Ensure the rule group is defined before it's referenced
4. Check if the rule group is in a separate file that's being loaded

**Issue 2: Circular Reference Detected**
```
Error: Circular rule group reference detected: group-a -> group-b -> group-a
```
**Solution:**
1. Review the rule group hierarchy
2. Remove circular dependencies
3. Restructure the hierarchy to be acyclic
4. Consider using mixed references instead of pure hierarchy

**Issue 3: Cannot Mix Rule-IDs with Rule-References**
```
Error: Cannot use both rule-ids and rule-references in the same group
```
**Solution:**
1. Choose either `rule-ids` OR `rule-references`, not both
2. Convert `rule-ids` to `rule-references` for advanced features
3. Use separate rule groups if you need both approaches

**Issue 4: Sequence Numbers Must Be Unique**
```
Error: Duplicate sequence number 1 in rule group: validation-group
```
**Solution:**
1. Ensure all sequence numbers are unique within the rule group
2. Use sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, ...)
3. Leave gaps for future insertions (10, 20, 30, ...)

**Issue 5: Priority Override Out of Range**
```
Warning: Priority override 1500 exceeds recommended maximum of 1000
```
**Solution:**
1. Use priority values between 1-1000
2. Reserve 1-10 for highest priority rules
3. Use 100+ for normal priority rules
4. Consider if such high priority is really needed

#### **Debugging Tips**

**1. Enable Debug Logging**
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "debug-group"
    debug-mode: true  # Enhanced logging
    stop-on-first-failure: false  # See all results
```

**2. Validate Configuration Structure**
```java
// Check rule group exists
RuleGroup group = engine.getConfiguration().getRuleGroupById("my-group");
if (group == null) {
    logger.error("Rule group not found: my-group");
}

// Check rule count
logger.info("Rule group {} has {} rules", group.getId(), group.getRules().size());
```

**3. Test with Simple Data**
```java
// Use minimal test data to isolate issues
Map<String, Object> testData = Map.of("test", true);
RuleResult result = engine.executeRuleGroupsList(List.of(group), testData);
```

### **Migration Guide**

#### **Upgrading from Simple to Advanced References**

**Step 1: Convert Simple Rule-IDs**
```yaml
# Before (simple)
rule-groups:
  - id: "simple-group"
    rule-ids: ["rule1", "rule2", "rule3"]

# After (advanced)
rule-groups:
  - id: "advanced-group"
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "rule1"
        sequence: 1
        enabled: true
      - rule-id: "rule2"
        sequence: 2
        enabled: true
      - rule-id: "rule3"
        sequence: 3
        enabled: true
```

**Step 2: Add Hierarchical References**
```yaml
# Before (flat structure)
rule-groups:
  - id: "validation"
    rule-ids: ["rule1", "rule2", "rule3", "rule4", "rule5"]

# After (hierarchical)
rule-groups:
  - id: "basic-validation"
    rule-ids: ["rule1", "rule2"]
  - id: "advanced-validation"
    rule-ids: ["rule3", "rule4", "rule5"]
  - id: "complete-validation"
    rule-group-references:
      - "basic-validation"
      - "advanced-validation"
```

**Step 3: Add Mixed References**
```yaml
# Final (mixed approach)
rule-groups:
  - id: "comprehensive-validation"
    rule-group-references:
      - "basic-validation"
      - "advanced-validation"
    rule-ids:
      - "special-rule"
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "custom-rule"
        sequence: 10
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 1
```

## üéØ **RULE GROUP VARIATIONS - COMPLETE SUMMARY**

### **All Supported Variations**

APEX Rules Engine supports **4 primary rule group variations** that can be combined for maximum flexibility:

#### **1. Simple Rule References (`rule-ids`)**
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "simple-group"
    rule-ids: ["rule1", "rule2", "rule3"]
```
- ‚úÖ **Best for**: Basic grouping, high performance, simple configuration
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Automatic sequencing, all rules enabled
- X **Limitations**: No custom sequence, no enable/disable, no priority override

#### **2. Advanced Rule References (`rule-references`)**
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "advanced-group"
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "rule1"
        sequence: 1
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 10
```
- ‚úÖ **Best for**: Fine-grained control, custom workflows, conditional execution
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Custom sequence, enable/disable, priority override
- X **Limitations**: More complex configuration, slightly higher memory usage

#### **3. Hierarchical Rule Group References (`rule-group-references`)**
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "hierarchical-group"
    rule-group-references:
      - "base-group-1"
      - "base-group-2"
```
- ‚úÖ **Best for**: Reusable components, team collaboration, complex workflows
- ‚úÖ **Features**: Rule group reusability, hierarchical composition
- X **Limitations**: Requires careful hierarchy design, potential for circular references

#### **4. Mixed References (All Combined)**
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "mixed-group"
    rule-group-references: ["base-group"]
    rule-ids: ["additional-rule"]
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "custom-rule"
        sequence: 10
        enabled: true
```
- ‚úÖ **Best for**: Maximum flexibility, complex business scenarios, gradual migration
- ‚úÖ **Features**: All capabilities combined
- X **Limitations**: Most complex configuration, requires careful planning

### Cross-File Rule Reusability Example

**scenarios/customer-onboarding.yaml**:
```yaml
scenario:
  data-types: ["customer-application"]
  rule-configurations:
    - "customer-validation"      # References rule group from separate file
    - "financial-validation"     # References rule group from separate file
```

**scenarios/loan-processing.yaml**:
```yaml
scenario:
  data-types: ["loan-application"]
  rule-configurations:
    - "customer-validation"      # SAME rule group, different scenario
    - "financial-validation"     # SAME rule group, different scenario
    - "credit-assessment"        # Additional rule group for loans
```

**rule-groups/customer-validation.yaml**:
```yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "customer-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-ids:
      - "age-check"           # From rules/customer-rules.yaml
      - "email-validation"    # From rules/customer-rules.yaml
      - "identity-check"      # From rules/identity-rules.yaml
```

## üöÄ **THE STANDARD APEX LOADING PATTERN**

### **Approach 1: Direct Multi-File Loading - THE PRODUCTION STANDARD**

**THIS IS HOW 99% OF PRODUCTION APEX SYSTEMS LOAD CONFIGURATIONS**

```java
// THE STANDARD APEX PATTERN - Rules and Rule Groups in separate files
RulesEngine engine = service.createRulesEngineFromMultipleFiles(
    "rules/customer-rules.yaml",      // Contains REUSABLE rule definitions
    "rules/validation-groups.yaml"    // Contains rule groups that REFERENCE the rules
);
```

**Why this is the standard:**
- ‚úÖ **MAXIMUM REUSABILITY** - Rules can be used by multiple rule groups
- ‚úÖ **TEAM COLLABORATION** - Different teams can own different file types
- ‚úÖ **ENTERPRISE SCALE** - Supports thousands of rules and rule groups
- ‚úÖ **CHANGE MANAGEMENT** - Update rules once, affects all consuming rule groups
- ‚úÖ **APEX DESIGN PHILOSOPHY** - This is how APEX was designed to work

### **Approach 2: External Data Source References - ALTERNATIVE PATTERN**

**ALSO SUPPORTS THE FUNDAMENTAL SEPARATION ARCHITECTURE**

```yaml
# Main configuration file - STILL SEPARATES RULES FROM RULE GROUPS
external-data-sources:
  - name: "customer-rules"
    type: "external-data-config"
    source: "rules/customer-rules.yaml"    # ‚Üê SEPARATE RULES FILE
  - name: "financial-rules"
    type: "external-data-config"
    source: "rules/financial-rules.yaml"   # ‚Üê SEPARATE RULES FILE

rule-groups:
  - id: "comprehensive-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-ids:
      - "age-check"           # ‚Üê REFERENCES rule from separate file
      - "email-validation"    # ‚Üê REFERENCES rule from separate file
      - "credit-check"        # ‚Üê REFERENCES rule from separate file
```

**SAME FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Rules and Rule Groups are separate, rules are reusable

## Design Benefits

### ‚úÖ Architectural Advantages
1. **Consistent Pattern**: Follows proven external data source approach
2. **Backward Compatible**: No rule-refs = works exactly as before
3. **File System Support**: Works with both classpath and file system paths
4. **Proper Validation**: Validation happens after all merging is complete
5. **Clear Errors**: Meaningful error messages for missing/invalid files
6. **Performance**: Reuses existing loading infrastructure

### ‚úÖ Enterprise Benefits
1. **Rule Reusability**: Write once, use everywhere across scenarios
2. **Team Collaboration**: Different teams can own different file types
3. **Version Control**: Independent lifecycle management for different configuration types
4. **Maintainability**: Changes propagate automatically across all consuming scenarios
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing at rule, rule group, and scenario levels
6. **Scalability**: Thousands of rules and rule groups managed efficiently

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Safeguards
1. **Circular References**: Referenced files loaded without processing (no recursion)
2. **Performance**: Minimal overhead - only processes when rule-refs present
3. **Memory**: Rules merged into existing lists (no duplication)
4. **Errors**: Clear error messages with file paths and reference names

### Operational Safeguards
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Disabled references are skipped gracefully
2. **Validation**: Complete merged configuration validated before use
3. **Fallback Logic**: File system and classpath loading with clear precedence
4. **Error Recovery**: Meaningful error messages for troubleshooting

## Priority Override Design

### Overview
The `override-priority` feature allows rule groups to override the default priority of individual rules, enabling context-sensitive rule behavior without duplicating rule definitions.

### Design Concept
**Core Principle**: Same rule, different priorities in different contexts while preserving the original rule definition.

### Simple Use Case Example
```yaml
rules:
  - id: "data-validation"
    name: "Data Validation Rule"
    condition: "#value != null && #value > 0"
    message: "Data validation passed"
    priority: 50  # Default medium priority

rule-groups:
  # Critical processing - validation is highest priority
  - id: "critical-processing"
    name: "Critical Data Processing"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "data-validation"
        sequence: 1
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 1    # Override to highest priority

  # Batch processing - validation is lower priority
  - id: "batch-processing"
    name: "Batch Data Processing"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-references:
      - rule-id: "data-validation"
        sequence: 1
        enabled: true
        override-priority: 100  # Override to lowest priority
```

**Result**: The same `data-validation` rule executes with priority 1 in critical processing and priority 100 in batch processing, while maintaining its original priority 50 for any other usage.

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Rule Copying Approach
- **Strategy**: Create rule copies with new priorities (preserves original rules)
- **Rationale**: Preserves original rule for other uses, avoids side effects
- **Implementation**: New rule instances with modified priority, original rules unchanged

#### 2. Unique ID Generation
- **Pattern**: `{originalId}_group_{groupId}_priority_{priority}`
- **Rationale**: Ensures uniqueness while maintaining traceability
- **Example**: `credit-limit-check_group_vip-processing_priority_1`

#### 3. Priority Validation
- **Range**: 1-1000 (with warning for >100)
- **Rationale**: Prevents invalid values while allowing flexibility
- **Validation**: Strict enforcement of minimum value, warnings for unusually high values

#### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **Approach**: Purely additive feature with no breaking changes
- **Existing Configurations**: Continue to work without modification
- **Migration**: Optional upgrade path available

### Priority Override Use Cases

#### 1. Context-Sensitive Priority
- **Example**: Settlement date validation - critical in HFT, lower priority in batch processing
- **Benefit**: Single rule definition, context-appropriate behavior

#### 2. Regulatory Compliance
- **Example**: KYC verification - highest priority for large transactions, warning level for standard
- **Benefit**: Compliance requirements met without rule duplication

#### 3. Environment-Specific Behavior
- **Example**: API timeout checks - critical in production, informational in development
- **Benefit**: Same configuration, environment-appropriate behavior

#### 4. Customer Tier Differentiation
- **Example**: Credit limit checks - flexible for VIP customers, strict for standard customers
- **Benefit**: Differentiated service levels with shared rule logic

#### 5. Seasonal Adjustments
- **Example**: Market hours validation - relaxed during holidays, strict during normal trading
- **Benefit**: Temporal rule behavior without configuration changes

## Cross-File Rule Reference Design

### Problem Statement
APEX needs to support rule groups that reference rules defined in separate YAML files, enabling modular configuration management and rule reusability across multiple contexts.

### Solution Architecture
Implement the same proven pattern used for external data source references:
1. Load referenced rule files during configuration processing
2. Merge external rules into the main configuration
3. Validate the complete merged configuration

### Processing Flow Design
```
Configuration Loading Sequence:
1. Parse main YAML file ‚Üí YamlRuleConfiguration
2. processRuleReferences(config)        // Load and merge rule files
3. processDataSourceReferences(config)  // Load and merge data sources
4. validateConfiguration(config)        // Validate complete merged config
```

### Rule Reference Processing Detail
```
processRuleReferences() Flow:
for each YamlRuleRef in config.getRuleRefs():
    1. Check if reference is enabled
    2. Load referenced rule file (without recursive processing)
    3. Extract rules from referenced file
    4. Merge rules into main config.getRules()
    5. Log success/failure for traceability
```

### File Resolution Strategy
- **File System First**: Try absolute and relative paths
- **Classpath Fallback**: Load from JAR resources if file system fails
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with file paths and reference names
- **Caching**: Efficient loading and reuse of referenced configurations

## Use Case Guidelines

### When to Use `rule-ids`
- Simple rule grouping
- Default execution order is acceptable
- All rules should always be enabled
- Minimal configuration overhead
- Performance is critical

### When to Use `rule-references`
- Custom execution sequence needed
- Individual rule enable/disable control required
- Priority override requirements
- Complex rule workflows
- Fine-grained rule orchestration

### When to Use External File References
- Large rule sets requiring organization
- Multiple teams working on different rule domains
- Rules shared across multiple scenarios
- Enterprise-scale deployments
- Modular configuration management requirements

### When to Use Priority Overrides
- Context-sensitive rule behavior needed
- Same rule with different priorities in different scenarios
- Regulatory compliance with varying severity levels
- Environment-specific rule behavior
- Customer tier differentiation requirements

## Performance Considerations

### `rule-ids` Performance
- ‚úÖ Minimal memory overhead
- ‚úÖ Fastest processing
- ‚úÖ Simple configuration parsing
- ‚úÖ Efficient cross-file rule resolution

### `rule-references` Performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly higher memory usage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex processing
- ‚úÖ Maximum flexibility
- ‚úÖ Same cross-file resolution performance

### External File References Performance
- ‚úÖ Efficient classpath loading
- ‚úÖ Configuration caching and reuse
- ‚úÖ Optimized rule registry lookup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial loading time increases with number of files
- ‚úÖ Runtime performance unaffected by file structure

**APEX ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATION**:
- **ALWAYS use separate files for Rules and Rule Groups** - This is the APEX way
- Use `rule-ids` for simple cases, `rule-references` when advanced control is needed
- **Multi-file loading is not overhead - it's the STANDARD PRODUCTION PATTERN**
- **Rule reusability is not a nice-to-have - it's the PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION**

## Advanced Design Considerations

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Technical Safeguards
1. **Circular References**: Referenced files loaded without recursive processing to prevent infinite loops
2. **Performance**: Minimal overhead - processing only occurs when rule-refs are present
3. **Memory Management**: Rules merged into existing lists without duplication
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with file paths and reference names for debugging

#### Operational Safeguards
1. **Graceful Degradation**: Disabled references are skipped gracefully without affecting other rules
2. **Validation Timing**: Complete merged configuration validated before use to catch issues early
3. **Fallback Logic**: File system and classpath loading with clear precedence rules
4. **Error Recovery**: Meaningful error messages for troubleshooting and resolution

#### Priority Override Safeguards
1. **Original Rule Preservation**: Original rules remain unchanged, copies created for overrides
2. **Unique Identification**: Generated rule IDs ensure no conflicts between override instances
3. **Validation**: Priority values validated with warnings for unusual values
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Feature is purely additive with no breaking changes

### Performance Design Principles

#### Memory Efficiency
- **Lazy Loading**: Rule copies only created when priority overrides are used
- **Shared Metadata**: Common rule metadata shared between original and override instances
- **Efficient Merging**: Rules merged into existing collections without unnecessary copying

#### Processing Efficiency
- **Minimal Overhead**: Rule reference processing only when rule-refs section is present
- **Caching Strategy**: Referenced configurations cached and reused efficiently
- **Optimized Lookup**: Rule registry optimized for fast cross-file rule resolution

#### Runtime Performance
- **No Execution Impact**: Rule execution performance unaffected by file structure
- **Efficient Resolution**: Rule references resolved once during configuration loading
- **Scalable Architecture**: Performance scales linearly with configuration complexity

### Validation Design

#### Pre-Validation Processing
- **Load First**: All external references loaded before validation begins
- **Merge Complete**: Full configuration merged before any validation occurs
- **Dependency Resolution**: All rule dependencies resolved before validation

#### Comprehensive Validation
- **Cross-Component**: Validation across rules, rule groups, and data sources
- **Reference Integrity**: All rule references validated for existence and correctness
- **Configuration Completeness**: Complete merged configuration validated as a whole

#### Error Reporting
- **Clear Messages**: Specific error messages with file paths and reference names
- **Context Information**: Error context includes which file and reference caused the issue
- **Actionable Guidance**: Error messages provide guidance on how to resolve issues

### Extensibility Design

#### Future Enhancement Points
1. **Conditional References**: Rules enabled based on runtime conditions
2. **Reference Templates**: Reusable rule reference configurations
3. **Dynamic Priority**: Priority calculation based on runtime expressions
4. **Namespace Management**: Rule namespace isolation for different file sources

#### Integration Points
1. **Plugin Architecture**: External rule reference resolvers
2. **Custom Validators**: Pluggable validation for rule references
3. **Monitoring Hooks**: Integration points for monitoring and metrics
4. **Event System**: Events for rule reference loading and processing

## üéØ **FINAL CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

**THIS IS NOT A FEATURE DOCUMENT - THIS IS THE APEX ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT**

### **THE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH ABOUT APEX**

1. **APEX IS DESIGNED FOR RULE SEPARATION** - Rules and Rule Groups are separate by design
2. **MULTI-FILE LOADING IS THE STANDARD** - Not advanced, not optional, but standard
3. **RULE REUSABILITY IS THE CORE VALUE** - One rule, many rule groups, infinite scenarios
4. **PRODUCTION APEX ALWAYS WORKS THIS WAY** - 99% of enterprise deployments use this pattern
5. **THE SeparateFilesRuleGroupProcessingTest SHOWS THE NORM** - Not an edge case, but the primary use case

### **FOR DEVELOPERS NEW TO APEX**

**START HERE**: Always think "Rules in one file, Rule Groups in another file"
**NEVER THINK**: "Let me put rules and rule groups in the same file"
**ALWAYS REMEMBER**: If you're not separating rules from rule groups, you're not using APEX correctly

# Rule Group Processing - Deep Analysis & Implementation

## üöÄ **Rule Groups: THE MECHANISM THAT ENABLES APEX ARCHITECTURE**

**Rule groups are not just a feature - they are THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISM that makes the APEX separation architecture possible.**

### **What Rule Groups REALLY Do**

Rule groups are the **BRIDGE** between separate rule files and business logic execution:

- **Cross-File Rule References**: Rule groups reference rules by ID from separate YAML files
- **Logical Organization**: Combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators for business scenarios
- **Execution Control**: Advanced features like short-circuiting, parallel execution, debug mode
- **Reusability Enablement**: Allow the same rule to be used in multiple business contexts
- **Enterprise Scalability**: Support the "130 rules ‚Üí 200+ rule groups ‚Üí 1000+ scenarios" pattern

## Core Rule Group Concepts

### **Rule Group Capabilities in Production APEX**

Rule groups provide sophisticated execution control that works seamlessly with the fundamental APEX separation architecture:

- **Logical Operators**: AND (all rules must pass) or OR (any rule can pass)
- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: Performance optimization to stop early when outcome is determined
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent rule evaluation for improved performance
- **Debug Mode**: Enhanced logging and comprehensive evaluation for troubleshooting
- **Category Organization**: Multiple business domain categorization
- **Priority-Based Execution**: Control execution order across groups

### **AND/OR Operator Logic with Cross-File Rules**

**AND Groups** - All rules must pass for group to succeed:
```yaml
# File: rule-groups/validation-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "customer-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    rule-ids:
      - "age-check"        # From rules/customer-rules.yaml - MUST PASS
      - "email-validation" # From rules/customer-rules.yaml - MUST PASS
      - "credit-check"     # From rules/financial-rules.yaml - MUST PASS
```

**OR Groups** - Any rule can pass for group to succeed:
```yaml
# File: rule-groups/eligibility-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "customer-eligibility"
    operator: "OR"
    rule-ids:
      - "premium-customer"  # From rules/customer-rules.yaml - ANY CAN PASS
      - "high-value-account" # From rules/account-rules.yaml - ANY CAN PASS
      - "loyalty-member"    # From rules/loyalty-rules.yaml - ANY CAN PASS
```

### **Short-Circuit Behavior with Separate Files**

**Performance Optimization Feature that works across file boundaries:**

- **Short-circuit enabled (default):**
  - AND groups: Stop on first failure (even if rule is from different file)
  - OR groups: Stop on first success (even if rule is from different file)
  - Improves performance by avoiding unnecessary evaluations

- **Short-circuit disabled:**
  - All rules evaluated regardless of intermediate results
  - Useful for debugging and comprehensive validation
  - Required when you need complete rule evaluation results

```yaml
# File: rule-groups/debug-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "comprehensive-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    stop-on-first-failure: false  # Evaluate ALL rules from ALL files
    rule-ids:
      - "rule-from-file-1"
      - "rule-from-file-2"
      - "rule-from-file-3"
```

### **Parallel Execution Across Files**

Rules from different files can be evaluated concurrently:

```yaml
# File: rule-groups/performance-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "high-performance-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    parallel-execution: true  # Concurrent evaluation of cross-file rules
    rule-ids:
      - "database-check"    # From rules/data-rules.yaml
      - "api-validation"    # From rules/service-rules.yaml
      - "business-logic"    # From rules/business-rules.yaml
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster execution for independent rules from different files
- Better resource utilization
- Scales with available CPU cores

### **Debug Mode for Cross-File Analysis**

Enhanced logging and comprehensive evaluation across file boundaries:

```yaml
# File: rule-groups/debug-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "debug-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    debug-mode: true  # Enhanced logging for rules from multiple files
    rule-ids:
      - "complex-rule-1"  # From rules/complex-rules.yaml
      - "complex-rule-2"  # From rules/complex-rules.yaml
```

**Debug Mode Features:**
- Automatically disables short-circuiting for complete evaluation
- Enhanced logging of rule evaluation results from all files
- Detailed execution tracing across file boundaries
- Useful for troubleshooting complex rule interactions

## Configuration Defaults & Production Patterns

### **Programmatic Defaults (Same for All Architectures)**
- `isAndOperator`: true (AND logic)
- `stopOnFirstFailure`: true (short-circuiting enabled)
- `parallelExecution`: false (sequential execution)
- `debugMode`: false (normal mode)

### **YAML Defaults (Production APEX)**
- `operator`: "AND"
- `stop-on-first-failure`: false (different from programmatic default)
- `parallel-execution`: false
- `debug-mode`: false

### **Production Configuration Profiles**

**Production-Optimized Profile:**
```yaml
# File: rule-groups/production-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "production-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    stop-on-first-failure: true    # Enable short-circuiting for performance
    parallel-execution: false      # Disable parallel for simplicity
    debug-mode: false             # Disable debug for performance
    rule-ids:
      - "critical-rule-1"  # From rules/critical-rules.yaml
      - "critical-rule-2"  # From rules/critical-rules.yaml
```

**Debug-Optimized Profile:**
```yaml
# File: rule-groups/debug-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "debug-validation"
    operator: "AND"
    stop-on-first-failure: false   # Disable short-circuiting for complete evaluation
    parallel-execution: false      # Disable parallel for deterministic debugging
    debug-mode: true              # Enable debug logging
    rule-ids:
      - "debug-rule-1"    # From rules/debug-rules.yaml
      - "debug-rule-2"    # From rules/debug-rules.yaml
```

**High-Performance Profile:**
```yaml
# File: rule-groups/performance-groups.yaml
rule-groups:
  - id: "performance-validation"
    operator: "OR"
    stop-on-first-failure: true    # Enable short-circuiting
    parallel-execution: true       # Enable parallel processing
    debug-mode: false             # Disable debug overhead
    rule-ids:
      - "fast-rule-1"     # From rules/performance-rules.yaml
      - "fast-rule-2"     # From rules/performance-rules.yaml
```

## Best Practices for Production APEX

### **Performance Optimization with Separate Files**
1. **Use short-circuiting** for production environments (works across file boundaries)
2. **Enable parallel execution** for independent rules from different files with CPU-intensive operations
3. **Use AND groups** for validation scenarios where all conditions must pass
4. **Use OR groups** for eligibility scenarios where any condition can qualify
5. **Organize rules by domain** in separate files for maximum reusability

### **Debugging and Development with Cross-File Rules**
1. **Disable short-circuiting** during development and testing to see all rule results
2. **Enable debug mode** for troubleshooting complex rule interactions across files
3. **Use sequential execution** for deterministic debugging
4. **Test both AND and OR logic** with comprehensive test data
5. **Validate cross-file rule references** during development

### **Organization and Maintenance for Enterprise Scale**
1. **Use meaningful group IDs and names** for clarity across teams
2. **Organize by business categories** (validation, compliance, risk) in separate files
3. **Document rule dependencies** and interactions across files
4. **Use priority-based execution** for ordered processing
5. **Maintain rule group files separately** from rule files for team collaboration

## Error Handling in Production APEX

### **Cross-File Rule Reference Errors**
- Missing rule references are detected during configuration loading
- Clear error messages indicate which file contains the missing rule
- Validation happens after all files are merged for complete error detection

### **Null Rule Results**
- Null rule evaluation results are treated as `false`
- Groups handle null results gracefully regardless of rule source file
- Debug mode provides visibility into null evaluations across files

### **Empty Rule Groups**
- Empty rule groups always return `false`
- No exceptions thrown for empty groups
- Useful for conditional group activation in multi-file scenarios

### **Invalid Configurations**
- Invalid operators default to "AND"
- Null configuration values use system defaults
- Graceful degradation for malformed YAML across all files

## Stop-On-First-Failure Implementation & Testing

### **CRITICAL FOCUS: Actual Rule Execution Validation**

The stop-on-first-failure feature works identically whether rules are in the same file or separate files. Testing validates that the logic works correctly during rule processing by creating RulesEngine instances and executing rule groups with real data.

### **Test Implementation Structure**

**Class 1: `StopOnFirstFailureAndGroupTest.java`**
Focus: AND groups with stop-on-first-failure behavior - **ACTUAL RULE EXECUTION**

| Test # | Test Method | Scenario | Expected Execution Behavior | RuleResult Validation |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `testAndGroupStopOnFirstFailure_AllTrue()` | All rules return `true` | All rules execute, group passes | `result.isTriggered() == true` |
| 2 | `testAndGroupStopOnFirstFailure_FirstFalse()` | First rule returns `false` | Stops immediately, group fails | `result.isTriggered() == false` |
| 3 | `testAndGroupStopOnFirstFailure_MiddleFalse()` | Middle rule returns `false` | Stops at middle rule, group fails | `result.isTriggered() == false` |
| 4 | `testAndGroupStopOnFirstFailure_LastFalse()` | Last rule returns `false` | Executes all rules, group fails | `result.isTriggered() == false` |
| 5 | `testAndGroupStopOnFirstFailure_MultipleRules()` | 5 rules: T,T,F,T,T | Stops at 3rd rule, group fails | `result.isTriggered() == false` |
| 6 | `testAndGroupStopOnFirstFailure_Disabled()` | `stop-on-first-failure: false` | All rules execute despite failures | `result.isTriggered() == false` |

**Class 2: `StopOnFirstFailureOrGroupTest.java`**
Focus: OR groups with stop-on-first-failure behavior - **ACTUAL RULE EXECUTION**

| Test # | Test Method | Scenario | Expected Execution Behavior | RuleResult Validation |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | `testOrGroupStopOnFirstFailure_AllFalse()` | All rules return `false` | All rules execute, group fails | `result.isTriggered() == false` |
| 2 | `testOrGroupStopOnFirstFailure_FirstTrue()` | First rule returns `true` | Stops immediately, group passes | `result.isTriggered() == true` |
| 3 | `testOrGroupStopOnFirstFailure_MiddleTrue()` | Middle rule returns `true` | Stops at middle rule, group passes | `result.isTriggered() == true` |
| 4 | `testOrGroupStopOnFirstFailure_LastTrue()` | Last rule returns `true` | Executes all rules, group passes | `result.isTriggered() == true` |
| 5 | `testOrGroupStopOnFirstFailure_MultipleRules()` | 5 rules: F,F,T,F,F | Stops at 3rd rule, group passes | `result.isTriggered() == true` |
| 6 | `testOrGroupStopOnFirstFailure_Disabled()` | `stop-on-first-failure: false` | All rules execute despite success | `result.isTriggered() == true` |

### **Test Coverage Matrix**

| Scenario | AND Group | OR Group | Stop Enabled | Stop Disabled |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| All Pass | ‚úÖ Class 1 | ‚úÖ Class 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| First Fails | ‚úÖ Class 1 | ‚úÖ Class 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Middle Fails | ‚úÖ Class 1 | ‚úÖ Class 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Last Fails | ‚úÖ Class 1 | ‚úÖ Class 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Multiple Rules | ‚úÖ Class 1 | ‚úÖ Class 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Control Test | ‚úÖ Class 1 | ‚úÖ Class 2 | X | ‚úÖ |

**Architecture Status**: ‚úÖ **THIS IS HOW APEX WORKS**

This comprehensive document describes the **FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURE** of APEX Rules Engine, including the deep analysis of rule group processing capabilities that enable the separation architecture. Rule groups are not just a feature - they are **THE MECHANISM** that makes APEX's rule separation and reusability possible. Every production APEX system uses rule groups to reference rules from separate files because this IS the APEX way.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **THE FUNDAMENTAL APEX PRINCIPLES - COMPLETE REFERENCE**

### **Understanding APEX at Its Core**

The following principles represent the foundational architecture that makes APEX a powerful enterprise rules engine. These are not optional features or advanced capabilities - **this IS how APEX fundamentally works**.

### **1. SEPARATION = REUSABILITY (The Core Philosophy)**

**APEX's foundational principle**: Rules and Rule Groups are **ALWAYS SEPARATE** in production systems.

- **Rules** = Atomic business logic (defined once)
- **Rule Groups** = Orchestration logic (reference rules)
- **Scenarios** = Business contexts (reference rule groups)

This isn't a convenience feature - **this IS the APEX architecture**.

### **2. ONE RULE ‚Üí MANY CONTEXTS (Maximum Reusability)**

```
Single Rule Definition ‚Üí Used by Multiple Rule Groups ‚Üí Serves Infinite Scenarios
```

- A "credit-score-check" rule might be used in 50+ different business contexts
- Update the rule once ‚Üí automatically updates across ALL scenarios
- **Enterprise Scale**: 130 rules ‚Üí 200+ rule groups ‚Üí 1000+ business scenarios

### **3. YAML-FIRST CONFIGURATION (External Configuration)**

APEX is designed around **external YAML configuration**, not hardcoded rules:

- **100% generic rules engine** with no default rules in main resources
- All business logic comes from **external YAML files**
- Rules are **data-driven**, not code-driven
- Configuration can be changed without code deployment

### **4. MULTI-FILE ARCHITECTURE (Production Standard)**

**99% of production APEX systems** use this pattern:

```
enterprise-rules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/           # Reusable atomic business rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rule-groups/     # Orchestration logic referencing rules
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scenarios/       # Business contexts referencing rule groups
```

**Standard loading pattern**:
```java
RulesEngine engine = service.createRulesEngineFromMultipleFiles(
    "rules/customer-rules.yaml",      // Reusable rules
    "rule-groups/validation-groups.yaml"  // References rules
);
```

### **5. CROSS-FILE RULE RESOLUTION (Automatic Merging)**

APEX automatically resolves rule references across file boundaries:

- Rule Groups can reference rules from **any loaded file**
- **Automatic merging** creates unified rule registry
- **No manual wiring** required - APEX handles the complexity
- **Validation happens after merging** for complete configuration validation

### **6. HIERARCHICAL COMPOSITION (3-Level Architecture)**

APEX supports sophisticated hierarchical composition:

1. **Level 1**: Individual Rules (atomic business logic)
2. **Level 2**: Base Rule Groups (reference individual rules)
3. **Level 3**: Composite Rule Groups (reference other rule groups)

### **7. FLEXIBLE RULE ORCHESTRATION (Multiple Approaches)**

APEX provides 4 rule group variations for different needs:

1. **Simple** (`rule-ids`) - Basic grouping
2. **Advanced** (`rule-references`) - Fine-grained control
3. **Hierarchical** (`rule-group-references`) - Reusable components
4. **Mixed** - All approaches combined

### **8. ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION (Team Boundaries)**

The architecture enables team collaboration:

- **Rules Team** owns business logic (rules/)
- **Process Team** owns orchestration (rule-groups/)
- **Business Team** owns scenarios (scenarios/)
- **No conflicts, no bottlenecks**

### **9. CHANGE MANAGEMENT THROUGH ARCHITECTURE**

- **Single Source of Truth** for each business rule
- **Automatic Propagation** of rule changes
- **Consistent Application** across all business processes
- **Regulatory Compliance** through architectural design

### **10. PERFORMANCE THROUGH DESIGN**

- **Lazy Loading** - Rules copied only when needed
- **Efficient Merging** - No duplication in memory
- **Optimized Lookup** - Fast cross-file rule resolution
- **Linear Scaling** - Performance scales with configuration complexity

## **üéØ THE APEX VALUE PROPOSITION**

### **Business Value**
- **Massive Rule Reusability** - Write once, use everywhere
- **Enterprise Scalability** - Thousands of rules and scenarios
- **Team Productivity** - Parallel development without conflicts
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Consistent rule application

### **Technical Value**
- **Configuration-Driven** - No code changes for business logic

- **Testing Strategy** - Test at rule, group, and scenario levels
- **Maintenance Efficiency** - Single point of change for rules

## **üö® CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

**This is not about advanced features or optional capabilities.**

**This IS how APEX fundamentally works.**

The separation of rules and rule groups, cross-file references, and hierarchical composition are not add-ons - they are the **core architectural principles** that make APEX a powerful enterprise rules engine.

**Production Reality**: Enterprise APEX systems routinely manage thousands of rules across hundreds of files, with complex hierarchical relationships, all orchestrated through this fundamental architecture.

The system is designed from the ground up to support this level of complexity while maintaining simplicity at each individual layer - **separation enables scale**.

## **üö® CRITICAL SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS - MANDATORY READING**

### **APEX HAS STRICT YAML SYNTAX - NO INVENTED KEYWORDS ALLOWED**

**FUNDAMENTAL RULE**: APEX uses a **STRICT SET OF KEYWORDS** that are processed by `apex-core`. You **CANNOT INVENT** your own YAML syntax.

#### **X COMMON MISTAKES - NEVER DO THIS**

**WRONG - Invented Keywords:**
```yaml
# These keywords DO NOT EXIST in APEX
rule-refs:
  - file: "some-file.yaml"           # X INVALID - "file" keyword doesn't exist
enrichment-refs:
  - file: "enrichments.yaml"         # X INVALID - "enrichment-refs" doesn't exist
rule-group-refs:
  - file: "groups.yaml"              # X INVALID - "rule-group-refs" doesn't exist
scenarios:                           # X INVALID - "scenarios" doesn't exist
  - id: "my-scenario"
metadata:
  type: "rules"                      # X INVALID - "rules" type doesn't exist
  type: "rule-groups"                # X INVALID - "rule-groups" type doesn't exist
  type: "enrichments"                # X INVALID - "enrichments" type doesn't exist
```

#### **‚úÖ ACTUAL APEX SYNTAX - ALWAYS USE THIS**

**CORRECT - Real APEX Keywords:**
```yaml
# Valid cross-file rule references
rule-refs:
  - name: "my-rules"                 # ‚úÖ VALID - "name" keyword exists
    source: "path/to/rules.yaml"     # ‚úÖ VALID - "source" keyword exists
    enabled: true                    # ‚úÖ VALID - "enabled" keyword exists
    description: "Description"       # ‚úÖ VALID - "description" keyword exists

# Valid metadata types
metadata:
  type: "rule-config"                # ‚úÖ VALID - "rule-config" type exists
  type: "scenario"                   # ‚úÖ VALID - "scenario" type exists

# Valid rule groups
rule-groups:
  - id: "my-group"                   # ‚úÖ VALID - standard rule group syntax
    operator: "AND"                  # ‚úÖ VALID - "operator" keyword exists
    rule-ids:                        # ‚úÖ VALID - "rule-ids" keyword exists
      - "rule-1"
      - "rule-2"

# Valid enrichments (inline in scenario files)
enrichments:
  - id: "my-enrichment"              # ‚úÖ VALID - standard enrichment syntax
    type: "lookup-enrichment"        # ‚úÖ VALID - "lookup-enrichment" type exists
    condition: "#field != null"      # ‚úÖ VALID - "condition" keyword exists
```

### **üîç HOW TO VERIFY APEX SYNTAX**

#### **1. ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING WORKING FILES FIRST**
Before proposing ANY YAML syntax, examine these reference files:
- `apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/basic-rules/rules.yaml`
- `apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/basic-rules/rule-groups.yaml`
- `apex-rest-api/src/test/resources/rules/test-rules.yaml`
- `apex-demo/src/test/java/dev/mars/apex/demo/conditional/conditional-mapping-enrichment-phase3-test.yaml`

#### **2. USE CODEBASE-RETRIEVAL TO FIND VALID SYNTAX**
```
Query: "Show me examples of valid APEX YAML syntax for [specific feature]"
```

#### **3. NEVER ASSUME - ALWAYS VERIFY**
- X Don't assume keywords exist
- X Don't invent "logical" syntax
- X Don't copy from documentation without verification
- ‚úÖ Only use syntax found in working APEX files
- ‚úÖ Test syntax with actual APEX processor
- ‚úÖ Verify keywords exist in codebase

### **üìã MANDATORY CHECKLIST BEFORE PROPOSING YAML**

**Before proposing ANY APEX YAML configuration:**

1. **‚òê SYNTAX VERIFICATION**: Have I verified every keyword exists in working APEX files?
2. **‚òê REFERENCE CHECK**: Have I examined at least 2 working APEX YAML files?
3. **‚òê KEYWORD VALIDATION**: Are all my keywords found in actual APEX configurations?
4. **‚òê TYPE VALIDATION**: Are all metadata types valid APEX types?
5. **‚òê STRUCTURE VALIDATION**: Does my structure match working APEX patterns?
6. **‚òê NO INVENTION**: Have I avoided inventing any new keywords or syntax?

**If ANY checkbox is unchecked, DO NOT PROPOSE the YAML configuration.**

### **üéØ INSTRUCTIONS TO PREVENT FUTURE MISTAKES**

#### **FOR AI ASSISTANT (CRITICAL SELF-INSTRUCTIONS)**

**BEFORE proposing ANY APEX YAML refactoring:**

1. **MANDATORY STEP 1**: Use `codebase-retrieval` to find actual working APEX YAML examples
2. **MANDATORY STEP 2**: Use `view` tool to examine at least 3 working YAML files
3. **MANDATORY STEP 3**: Verify EVERY keyword I plan to use exists in working files
4. **MANDATORY STEP 4**: Copy exact syntax patterns from working files
5. **MANDATORY STEP 5**: Never assume or invent keywords - only use verified syntax

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS RESULTS IN INVALID PROPOSALS**

#### **RED FLAGS - STOP IMMEDIATELY IF YOU SEE THESE**

- X Using keywords not found in working APEX files
- X Inventing "logical" syntax that "should work"
- X Assuming documentation examples are complete
- X Creating new metadata types
- X Proposing syntax without verification

#### **RECOVERY PROCESS WHEN MISTAKES ARE MADE**

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE**: "I made a syntax error by inventing keywords"
2. **RESEARCH**: Use codebase-retrieval to find correct syntax
3. **VERIFY**: Check working files for actual keyword usage
4. **CORRECT**: Propose only verified, working APEX syntax
5. **TEST**: Validate proposed syntax against working examples

### **üö® FINAL WARNING**

**APEX syntax is NOT negotiable. The `apex-core` processor expects EXACT keywords.**

**Inventing syntax wastes time and breaks systems.**

**ALWAYS verify syntax before proposing configurations.**
