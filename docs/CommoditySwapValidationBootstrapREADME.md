## Prerequisites

### What You Need to Get Started

**Required (Must Have):**
- **Java 17 or higher** - APEX uses modern Java features for optimal performance
- **Maven 3.6 or higher** - For building and running the demonstration

**Optional (Nice to Have):**
- **PostgreSQL 12 or higher** - For the full database integration experience
- **Database admin privileges** - To create the demonstration database

**Don't worry if you don't have PostgreSQL!** The bootstrap is designed to work in any environment. If PostgreSQL isn't available, it automatically switches to in-memory simulation mode, so you can still experience all of APEX's features.

### What Happens in Each Mode

**With PostgreSQL (Full Experience):**
- Creates a real `apex_commodity_demo` database
- Populates tables with realistic test data
- Demonstrates full database integration features
- Shows production-ready database patterns

**Without PostgreSQL (Simulation Mode):**
- Uses in-memory data structures
- Same validation logic and business rules
- All APEX features work identically
- Perfect for learning and development

## Quick Start - Get Running in 2 Minutes

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
cd apex-rules-engine
mvn clean compile
```

**What this does:** Compiles all the APEX code and downloads any dependencies you need.

### 2. Run the Bootstrap
Choose the method that works best for your environment:

**Option A: Using Maven (Recommended)**
```bash
# From the project root directory
mvn exec:java -pl apex-demo -Dexec.mainClass="dev.mars.apex.demo.validation.CommoditySwapValidationBootstrap"
```

**Option B: Direct Java Execution**
```bash
# Navigate to the demo module
cd apex-demo

# Run directly with Java
java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*" dev.mars.apex.demo.validation.CommoditySwapValidationBootstrap
```

**What to expect:** The bootstrap will start up, detect your environment, and begin running through all six demonstration scenarios automatically.

### 3. What You'll See - Understanding the Output

## Configuration Details

### Database Configuration - Flexible Setup

The bootstrap is designed to work in any environment with sensible defaults that you can easily customize.

**Default Database Settings:**
- **Host**: localhost (your local machine)
- **Port**: 5432 (PostgreSQL standard port)
- **Database**: apex_commodity_demo (created automatically)
- **Username**: postgres (PostgreSQL default)
- **Password**: postgres (PostgreSQL default)

**Need Different Settings?**
If your PostgreSQL setup uses different credentials or runs on a different server, you can easily customize the connection by modifying these constants in `CommoditySwapValidationBootstrap.java`:

```java
// Change these to match your PostgreSQL setup
private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:postgresql://your-host:5432/";
private static final String DB_USER = "your-username";
private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "your-password";
```

**Common Customizations:**
- **Different host**: Change `localhost` to your database server's IP or hostname
- **Different port**: Change `5432` to your PostgreSQL port
- **Different credentials**: Update username and password to match your setup
- **Different database name**: Change `apex_commodity_demo` to your preferred name

**No PostgreSQL? No Problem!**
If you don't have PostgreSQL installed or configured, the bootstrap automatically detects this and switches to in-memory simulation mode. You'll get the same learning experience without any database setup required.

## Understanding the YAML Configuration

The YAML configuration file is where the magic happens - it's where all the business logic, validation rules, and data enrichment instructions are defined. This section will help you understand how it works and how you can modify it for your own needs.

### Why YAML Configuration Matters

**Business User Friendly**: Unlike traditional systems where validation logic is buried in code, APEX puts all the business rules in a readable YAML file that business users can understand and modify.

**Version Control Ready**: YAML files work perfectly with Git, so you can track changes, review modifications, and roll back if needed.

**Environment Flexible**: The same configuration can work across development, testing, and production environments with simple overrides.

**Documentation Built-In**: Every rule and setting can include descriptions and business context right in the configuration.

### Configuration File Location
```
apex-demo/src/main/resources/bootstrap/commodity-swap-validation-bootstrap.yaml
```

This 280-line YAML file contains everything needed to validate commodity swaps - no business logic is hidden in Java code.

### YAML Structure Overview

The configuration is organized into four main sections:

```yaml
metadata:           # Who, what, when, why - documentation and governance
rule-chains:        # The validation logic - 4 different approaches
enrichments:        # Data enhancement - 3 lookup layers
configuration:      # Global settings - thresholds, performance, business rules
```

**What each section does:**
- **Metadata**: Provides documentation, versioning, and business context
- **Rule-chains**: Contains the actual validation logic using different APEX patterns
- **Enrichments**: Defines how to automatically populate missing data
- **Configuration**: Sets global parameters, thresholds, and business settings

### Complete YAML Configuration - A Guided Tour

This section walks you through the complete YAML configuration file, explaining each part in detail. Don't worry if it seems complex at first - we'll break it down into understandable pieces.

**Why this configuration matters:**
This 280-line YAML file contains all the business logic for validating commodity swaps. The beauty of APEX is that business users can modify these rules without touching any Java code. Let's explore how it's organized.

#### Section 1: Metadata - Documentation and Governance

The metadata section is like the "cover page" of your configuration - it tells you what this file does, who owns it, and when it was created.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "Commodity Swap Validation Bootstrap"           # What this configuration does
  version: "1.0"                                       # Version for tracking changes
  description: "Complete commodity derivatives validation and enrichment demonstration"
  created-by: "financial.admin@company.com"           # Who created this
  business-domain: "Commodity Derivatives"            # What business area it covers
  business-owner: "Trading Desk"                      # Which team owns the business logic
  created-date: "2025-07-31"                         # When it was created
  last-modified: "2025-07-31"                        # Last update date
```

**Why include metadata?**
- **Governance**: Know who to contact when rules need changes
- **Version control**: Track changes over time
- **Documentation**: Understand the purpose and scope
- **Compliance**: Meet audit requirements for business rule management

#### Section 2: Rule Chains - The Heart of Your Validation Logic

Rule chains are where the actual business logic lives. Think of each rule chain as a different "validation strategy" - some are simple, others are sophisticated. This configuration defines four different approaches.

##### Rule Chain 1: Ultra-Simple Validation (The Foundation)

This is your basic data quality check - making sure essential information is present before doing anything expensive.

```yaml
rule-chains:
  # Ultra-Simple API validation chain
  - id: "ultra-simple-validation"                      # Unique identifier for this chain
    name: "Ultra-Simple Validation Rules"              # Human-readable name
    description: "Basic field validation using ultra-simple API"  # What this chain does
    pattern: "conditional-chaining"                    # How the rules work together
    enabled: true                                      # Turn this chain on/off
    priority: 100                                      # Lower numbers run first
    configuration:                                     # The actual validation logic
      trigger-rule:                                    # The "gatekeeper" rule
        id: "basic-fields-check"
        condition: "tradeId != null && counterpartyId != null && clientId != null"
        message: "Basic required fields validation"
        description: "Ensures all essential trade identifiers are present"
      conditional-rules:                               # What happens based on the trigger
        on-trigger:                                    # If trigger passes, run these rules
          - id: "notional-positive"
            condition: "notionalAmount != null && notionalAmount > 0"
            message: "Notional amount must be positive"
            description: "Validates notional amount is greater than zero"
          - id: "commodity-type-required"
            condition: "commodityType != null && commodityType.trim().length() > 0"
            message: "Commodity type is required"
            description: "Ensures commodity type is specified"
        on-no-trigger:                                 # If trigger fails, run this instead
          - id: "basic-validation-failure"
            condition: "true"                          # Always executes
            message: "Basic field validation failed"
            description: "One or more required fields are missing"
```

**Understanding the logic:**
1. **First**, check if essential IDs are present (tradeId, counterpartyId, clientId)
2. **If YES**: Check that notional amount is positive and commodity type is specified
3. **If NO**: Immediately fail with a clear error message

**Why use conditional chaining here?**
It's efficient - if basic data is missing, there's no point checking other fields. This pattern saves processing time and provides clear feedback.

##### Rule Chain 2: Template-Based Business Rules (The Scorer)

This chain uses a different approach - instead of simple pass/fail, it builds up a score based on multiple business criteria. Different rules have different importance levels.

```yaml
  # Template-based business rules chain
  - id: "template-business-rules"                      # Unique identifier
    name: "Template-Based Business Rules"              # Human-readable name
    description: "Business logic validation using template-based rules"
    pattern: "accumulative-chaining"                   # This pattern builds up scores
    enabled: true                                      # Turn this chain on/off
    priority: 200                                      # Runs after ultra-simple (100)
    configuration:
      accumulative-rules:                              # Rules that contribute to a total score
        - id: "maturity-eligibility"                   # Rule 1: Check maturity date
          condition: "maturityDate != null && maturityDate.isBefore(tradeDate.plusYears(5))"
          weight: 25                                   # Worth 25 points if it passes
          message: "TradeB maturity within 5 years"
          description: "Validates trade maturity is within acceptable range"
```

**Understanding accumulative chaining:**
- Each rule that passes contributes its "weight" in points to a total score
- Rules with higher weights are more important to your business
- At the end, the total score determines the outcome (approve/warn/reject)

**Why weight this rule at 25 points?**
Maturity date is important for risk management - trades that mature too far in the future carry more risk, so this gets significant weight in the decision.
        - id: "currency-consistency"                       # Rule 2: Check currency matching
          condition: "notionalCurrency == paymentCurrency && paymentCurrency == settlementCurrency"
          weight: 20                                   # Worth 20 points if it passes
          message: "All currencies must match"
          description: "Ensures currency consistency across trade legs"

        - id: "settlement-terms"                       # Rule 3: Check settlement timing
          condition: "settlementDays != null && settlementDays >= 0 && settlementDays <= 5"
          weight: 15                                   # Worth 15 points if it passes
          message: "Settlement within 5 days"
          description: "Validates settlement period is within acceptable range"

        # Commodity-specific validation rules (only one will apply per trade)
        - id: "energy-commodity-validation"            # Rule 4a: For energy commodities
          condition: "commodityType == 'ENERGY' && (referenceIndex == 'WTI' || referenceIndex == 'BRENT' || referenceIndex == 'HENRY_HUB')"
          weight: 30                                   # Worth 30 points - highest weight!
          message: "Valid energy commodity and index"
          description: "Ensures energy commodities use valid reference indices"

        - id: "metals-commodity-validation"            # Rule 4b: For metals commodities
          condition: "commodityType == 'METALS' && (referenceIndex == 'GOLD' || referenceIndex == 'SILVER' || referenceIndex == 'COPPER')"
          weight: 30                                   # Worth 30 points - highest weight!
          message: "Valid metals commodity and index"
          description: "Ensures metals commodities use valid reference indices"

        - id: "agricultural-commodity-validation"      # Rule 4c: For agricultural commodities
          condition: "commodityType == 'AGRICULTURAL' && (referenceIndex == 'CORN' || referenceIndex == 'WHEAT' || referenceIndex == 'SOYBEANS')"
          weight: 30                                   # Worth 30 points - highest weight!
          message: "Valid agricultural commodity and index"
          description: "Ensures agricultural commodities use valid reference indices"

      thresholds:                                      # Decision boundaries based on total score
        approval-score: 70                             # Need 70+ points for full approval
        warning-score: 50                              # Need 50+ points for conditional approval
```

**How the scoring works:**
- **Maximum possible score**: 90 points (25 + 20 + 15 + 30)
- **Typical score for valid trade**: 90 points (all rules pass)
- **Score for trade with settlement issues**: 75 points (missing 15 points, still approved)
- **Score for trade with currency mismatch**: 70 points (missing 20 points, still approved)
- **Score for invalid commodity**: 60 points (missing 30 points, gets warning)

**Why these weights?**
- **Commodity validation (30 points)**: Most important - wrong commodity type breaks everything
- **Maturity eligibility (25 points)**: High importance - affects risk exposure
- **Currency consistency (20 points)**: Medium importance - affects operations
- **Settlement terms (15 points)**: Lower importance - operational convenience

##### Rule Chain 3: Advanced Configuration (The Specialist)

This chain demonstrates APEX's most sophisticated validation capabilities, including pattern matching and complex business logic.

```yaml
  # Advanced configuration chain
  - id: "advanced-validation"                          # Unique identifier
    name: "Advanced Configuration Rules"               # Human-readable name
    description: "Complex validation using advanced configuration"
    pattern: "conditional-chaining"                    # Back to conditional pattern
    enabled: true                                      # Turn this chain on/off
    priority: 300                                      # Runs after template-based (200)
    configuration:
      trigger-rule:                                    # The gatekeeper for advanced checks
        id: "advanced-eligibility"
        condition: "tradeId != null && tradeId.matches('^TRS[0-9]{3}$')"  # Regular expression!
        message: "Trade ID format validation"
        description: "Validates trade ID follows TRS### format"
      conditional-rules:
        on-trigger:                                    # If trade ID format is correct
          - id: "notional-range-check"                 # Check notional amount range
            condition: "notionalAmount >= 1000000 && notionalAmount <= 100000000"
            message: "Notional must be between $1M and $100M"
            description: "Validates notional amount is within acceptable range"
          - id: "regulatory-compliance"                # Check regulatory fields
            condition: "jurisdiction != null && regulatoryRegime != null"
            message: "Regulatory information required"
            description: "Ensures regulatory compliance fields are populated"
          - id: "funding-spread-validation"            # Check funding spread
```

**Understanding the regular expression:**
- `^TRS[0-9]{3}$` means:
  - `^` = start of string
  - `TRS` = literal text "TRS"
  - `[0-9]{3}` = exactly 3 digits
  - `$` = end of string
- So valid IDs are: TRS001, TRS002, TRS999
- Invalid IDs are: TRS1, TRS1234, ABC001

**Why use conditional chaining here?**
If the trade ID format is wrong, there's no point checking other advanced criteria. This saves processing time and provides clear feedback about the fundamental problem.

#### Section 3: Enrichments - Automatic Data Population

Enrichments are one of APEX's most powerful features. They automatically add missing information to your data by looking it up from reference sources. Think of enrichments as "smart autocomplete" for your business data.

**Why enrichments matter:**
Your trade data might come in with just an ID like "CLI001", but your business rules need to know the client name, risk rating, and regulatory classification. Instead of writing code to look this up, APEX does it automatically.

```yaml
enrichments:
  # Client data enrichment
  - id: "client-enrichment"                            # Unique identifier for this enrichment
    name: "Client Data Enrichment"                     # Human-readable name
    description: "Enrich trade with client information" # What this enrichment does
    type: "lookup"                                     # Type of enrichment (lookup from data)
    enabled: true                                      # Turn this enrichment on/off
    source: "client_data"                              # Which data source to use
    key-field: "clientId"                              # Field to match on (CLI001, CLI002, etc.)
    mappings:                                          # What data to copy over
      - source-field: "client_name"                    # From the lookup data
        target-field: "clientName"                     # To your trade object
        description: "Client name lookup"              # What this mapping does
      - source-field: "regulatory_classification"      # From the lookup data
        target-field: "clientRegulatoryClassification" # To your trade object
        description: "Client regulatory classification"
      - source-field: "risk_rating"                    # From the lookup data
        target-field: "clientRiskRating"               # To your trade object
        description: "Client risk rating"
```

**How this works in practice:**
1. **Input**: Your trade has `clientId = "CLI001"`
2. **Lookup**: APEX finds the client record with ID "CLI001"
3. **Enrichment**: APEX copies the client name, regulatory classification, and risk rating to your trade object
4. **Result**: Your trade now has `clientName = "Energy Trading Fund Alpha"`, `clientRegulatoryClassification = "INSTITUTIONAL"`, etc.

**Business value**: Your rules can now use rich client information instead of just IDs, enabling more sophisticated business logic.

  # Counterparty data enrichment
  - id: "counterparty-enrichment"                      # Unique identifier
    name: "Counterparty Data Enrichment"               # Human-readable name
    description: "Enrich trade with counterparty information"
    type: "lookup"                                     # Type of enrichment
    enabled: true                                      # Turn this enrichment on/off
    source: "counterparty_data"                        # Which data source to use
    key-field: "counterpartyId"                        # Field to match on (CP001, CP002, etc.)
    mappings:                                          # What data to copy over
      - source-field: "counterparty_name"              # From the lookup data
        target-field: "counterpartyName"               # To your trade object
        description: "Counterparty name lookup"        # What this mapping does
      - source-field: "credit_rating"                  # From the lookup data
        target-field: "counterpartyCreditRating"       # To your trade object
        description: "Counterparty credit rating"      # What this mapping does
```

**Example transformation:**
- **Before enrichment**: `counterpartyId = "CP001"`
- **After enrichment**:
  - `counterpartyId = "CP001"`
  - `counterpartyName = "Global Investment Bank"`
  - `counterpartyCreditRating = "AA-"`

**Why this matters**: Credit ratings are crucial for risk management. Instead of just knowing you're trading with "CP001", you now know it's "Global Investment Bank" with an "AA-" credit rating.
      - source-field: "regulatory_status"
        target-field: "counterpartyRegulatoryStatus"
        description: "Counterparty regulatory status"

  # Commodity reference data enrichment
  - id: "commodity-enrichment"                         # Unique identifier
    name: "Commodity Reference Data Enrichment"        # Human-readable name
    description: "Enrich trade with commodity reference data"
    type: "lookup"                                     # Type of enrichment
    enabled: true                                      # Turn this enrichment on/off
    source: "commodity_reference_data"                 # Which data source to use
    key-field: "referenceIndex"                        # Field to match on (WTI, GOLD, CORN, etc.)
    mappings:                                          # What data to copy over
      - source-field: "index_provider"                 # From the lookup data
        target-field: "indexProvider"                  # To your trade object
        description: "Index provider lookup"           # What this mapping does
      - source-field: "quote_currency"                 # From the lookup data
        target-field: "commodityQuoteCurrency"         # To your trade object
        description: "Commodity quote currency"        # What this mapping does
      - source-field: "unit_of_measure"                # From the lookup data
        target-field: "commodityUnitOfMeasure"         # To your trade object
        description: "Unit of measure"                 # What this mapping does
      - source-field: "commodity_name"                 # From the lookup data
        target-field: "commodityName"                  # To your trade object
        description: "Commodity name"                  # What this mapping does
```

**Example transformation:**
- **Before enrichment**: `referenceIndex = "WTI"`
- **After enrichment**:
  - `referenceIndex = "WTI"`
  - `indexProvider = "NYMEX"`
  - `commodityQuoteCurrency = "USD"`
  - `commodityUnitOfMeasure = "BARREL"`
  - `commodityName = "West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil"`

**Why this matters**: This transforms a simple code like "WTI" into complete commodity information that your business rules and reports can use.

#### Section 4: Configuration - Global Settings and Business Parameters

The configuration section contains global settings and business parameters that are used across all the rule chains.

```yaml
configuration:
  # Processing thresholds - Business limits and boundaries
  thresholds:
    minNotionalAmount: 1000000      # $1M minimum - No small trades
    maxNotionalAmount: 100000000    # $100M maximum - Large trade approval required
    maxMaturityYears: 5             # 5 years maximum maturity - Risk management limit
    validationScore: 70             # Minimum validation score for approval

  # Performance settings
  performance:
    maxProcessingTimeMs: 100        # Maximum allowed processing time
    enableCaching: true             # Cache lookup results for performance
    cacheExpiryMinutes: 60          # Cache expires after 1 hour

  # Audit and compliance
  audit:
    enableAuditTrail: true          # Log all validation decisions
    auditLevel: "DETAILED"          # Level of detail in audit logs
    retentionDays: 90               # Keep audit logs for 90 days
```

**Understanding the business parameters:**
- **Notional limits**: Define the range of trade sizes your organization will accept
- **Maturity limits**: Control risk exposure by limiting how far into the future trades can extend
- **Validation score**: Set the minimum score required for automatic approval
- **Performance settings**: Ensure the system meets your speed requirements
- **Audit settings**: Meet compliance requirements for trade validation logging

## Demonstration Scenarios - What You'll See in Action

Now let's walk through each of the six scenarios you'll see when you run the bootstrap. Each scenario builds on the previous one, showing you different aspects of APEX's capabilities.

### Scenario 1: Ultra-Simple API - Your First APEX Experience

**What this scenario shows:** How to validate basic data quality using APEX's simplest API

**Business context:** Before processing any commodity swap, you need to ensure the essential data is present and valid. This scenario checks the fundamental requirements that every swap must meet.

**What gets validated:**
- **Trade ID exists**: Every swap needs a unique identifier
- **Counterparty ID exists**: Must know who the other party is
- **Client ID exists**: Must know which client this swap belongs to
- **Notional amount is positive**: Can't have zero or negative value swaps
- **Commodity type is specified**: Must know what type of commodity (Energy, Metals, Agricultural)

**Sample trade data:**
```
Trade ID: TRS001
Commodity: ENERGY - WTI (West Texas Intermediate crude oil)
Notional: $10,000,000
Counterparty: Global Investment Bank
Client: Energy Trading Fund Alpha
```

**What you'll see:**
```
--- SCENARIO 1: ULTRA-SIMPLE API DEMONSTRATION ---
Testing Ultra-Simple API validation:
Trade: TRS001 (ENERGY - WTI)
   ✓ Trade ID validation: PASS
   ✓ Counterparty validation: PASS
   ✓ Client validation: PASS
   ✓ Notional validation: PASS
   ✓ Commodity type validation: PASS
   ✓ Overall validation: PASS
   ✓ Processing time: 92ms
```

**Why this matters:** This basic validation catches data quality problems early, before expensive processing begins. In production, this prevents downstream errors and ensures clean data flows through your systems.

### Scenario 2: Template-Based Rules - Structured Business Logic

**What this scenario shows:** How to implement sophisticated business logic using APEX's template-based approach with weighted scoring

**Business context:** After basic validation, you need to check business rules that determine whether a swap meets your organization's trading criteria. Different rules have different importance levels, so APEX uses a weighted scoring system.

**What gets validated:**
- **Maturity eligibility** (25 points): Trade must mature within 5 years
- **Currency consistency** (20 points): All currencies must match across the trade
- **Settlement terms** (15 points): Settlement must be within 5 business days
- **Commodity validation** (30 points): Must use valid reference indices for the commodity type

**How scoring works:**
- Each rule that passes contributes its points to the total score
- **70+ points**: Full approval
- **50-69 points**: Warning (conditional approval)
- **Below 50 points**: Rejection

**Sample trade data:**
```
Trade ID: TRS002
Commodity: METALS - GOLD
Notional: $5,000,000
Maturity: 2 years from trade date
All currencies: USD
Settlement: T+2 (2 days)
Reference index: GOLD (valid for metals)
```

**What you'll see:**
```
--- SCENARIO 2: TEMPLATE-BASED RULES DEMONSTRATION ---
Testing Template-Based Rules validation:
Trade: TRS002 (METALS - GOLD)
   ✓ Validation result: PASS
   ✓ Rules passed: 7
   ✓ Rules failed: 0
   ✓ Business rules result: PASS
   ✓ Processing time: 11ms
```

**Why this matters:** This weighted scoring approach lets you implement nuanced business logic where some rules are more important than others. It's perfect for scenarios where you want partial compliance with graduated responses.

### Scenario 3: Advanced Configuration - Complex Business Rules

**What this scenario shows:** How to handle sophisticated validation requirements using APEX's most powerful features

**Business context:** Some trades require complex validation that goes beyond simple field checks. This scenario demonstrates advanced pattern matching, range validation, and regulatory compliance checks.

**What gets validated:**
- **Trade ID format**: Must follow exact pattern (TRS followed by 3 digits)
- **Notional range**: Must be between $1M and $100M
- **Regulatory compliance**: Must have jurisdiction and regulatory regime specified
- **Funding spread**: Must be between 0 and 1000 basis points (0% to 10%)

**Sample trade data:**
```
Trade ID: TRS003 (matches TRS### pattern)
Commodity: AGRICULTURAL - CORN
Notional: $2,500,000 (within $1M-$100M range)
Jurisdiction: US
Regulatory Regime: CFTC
Funding Spread: 200 basis points (2%)
```

**What you'll see:**
```
--- SCENARIO 3: ADVANCED CONFIGURATION DEMONSTRATION ---
Testing Advanced Configuration validation:
Trade: TRS003 (AGRICULTURAL - CORN)
   ✓ trade-id-format: PASS
   ✓ notional-range: PASS
   ✓ regulatory-compliance: PASS
   ✓ funding-spread-check: PASS
   ✓ Processing time: 23ms
```

**Why this matters:** This shows how APEX can handle the most complex validation requirements, including pattern matching and multi-condition logic, while maintaining readable configuration.

### Scenario 4: Static Data Enrichment - Automatic Data Population

**What this scenario shows:** How APEX automatically enriches your data by looking up information from reference sources

**Business context:** Raw trade data often contains just IDs and codes. APEX can automatically populate full names, classifications, and other details by looking up information from your reference data sources.

**What gets enriched:**
- **Client information**: Name, type, regulatory classification, risk rating
- **Counterparty information**: Name, credit rating, regulatory status
- **Currency information**: Full name, decimal places, country code
- **Commodity information**: Full name, index provider, unit of measure

**Sample enrichment process:**
```
Input:  clientId = "CLI001"
Lookup: Client reference data
Output: clientName = "Energy Trading Fund Alpha"
        clientType = "INSTITUTIONAL"
        clientRiskRating = "LOW"
```

**What you'll see:**
```
--- SCENARIO 4: STATIC DATA VALIDATION & ENRICHMENT ---
Testing Static Data validation and enrichment:
Trade: TRS001 (ENERGY - WTI)

1. Client Validation:
   ✓ Client found: Energy Trading Fund Alpha
   ✓ Client type: INSTITUTIONAL
   ✓ Risk rating: LOW

2. Counterparty Validation:
   ✓ Counterparty found: Global Investment Bank
   ✓ Credit rating: AA-

3. Commodity Reference Validation:
   ✓ Commodity found: West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil
   ✓ Index provider: NYMEX

   ✓ Processing time: 2ms
```

**Why this matters:** This transforms sparse trade data into complete business objects automatically, providing all the context needed for downstream processing and reporting.

### Scenario 5: Performance Monitoring - Production Readiness

**What this scenario shows:** How APEX monitors its own performance and provides metrics for production capacity planning

**Business context:** In production, you need to know how fast your validation system is running and whether it meets your performance requirements. This scenario processes multiple swaps and measures performance.

**What gets measured:**
- **Individual processing times**: How long each swap takes to validate
- **Batch processing performance**: Total time for multiple swaps
- **Average processing time**: Performance per swap
- **Performance target compliance**: Whether you're meeting your SLA requirements

**Sample performance test:**
```
Process 3 different swaps simultaneously:
- TRS001 (Energy - WTI)
- TRS002 (Metals - Gold)
- TRS003 (Agricultural - Corn)
```

**What you'll see:**
```
--- SCENARIO 5: PERFORMANCE MONITORING DEMONSTRATION ---
Testing Performance monitoring capabilities:
   ✓ Swap 1 (TRS001): 4ms - VALID
   ✓ Swap 2 (TRS002): 3ms - VALID
   ✓ Swap 3 (TRS003): 4ms - VALID
   ✓ Total processing time: 11ms
   ✓ Average per swap: 3.7ms
   ✓ Target: <100ms per swap ✓ MEETING TARGET
```

**Why this matters:** This demonstrates that APEX can handle production workloads efficiently, with sub-100ms processing times that enable real-time validation.

### Scenario 6: Exception Handling - Robust Error Management

**What this scenario shows:** How APEX handles invalid data and error conditions gracefully

**Business context:** Real-world data isn't always perfect. This scenario shows how APEX handles various error conditions while maintaining system stability and providing clear error messages.

**What error conditions are tested:**
- **Invalid trade ID format**: Trade ID that doesn't match the required pattern
- **Null values**: Missing required data fields
- **Invalid commodity types**: Commodity types that aren't supported
- **Out-of-range values**: Data that falls outside acceptable limits

**Sample error scenarios:**
```
Test 1: Trade ID = "INVALID_ID" (should be TRS###)
Test 2: Notional Amount = null (should be positive number)
Test 3: Commodity Type = "INVALID_TYPE" (should be ENERGY/METALS/AGRICULTURAL)
```

**What you'll see:**
```
--- SCENARIO 6: EXCEPTION HANDLING DEMONSTRATION ---
Testing Exception handling scenarios:

1. Invalid Trade ID Format:
   ✗ Expected: TRS### format, Got: INVALID_ID

2. Null Notional Amount:
   ✗ Notional amount is required and must be positive

3. Invalid Commodity Type:
   ✗ Supported types: [ENERGY, METALS, AGRICULTURAL], Got: INVALID_TYPE

   ✓ Processing time: 3ms
   ✓ System remained stable during error conditions
```

**Why this matters:** This shows that APEX provides robust error handling with clear, actionable error messages, helping operations teams quickly identify and fix data problems.

## Summary - What You've Learned

## Advanced Features Deep Dive

*This section provides detailed technical information about the advanced APEX features demonstrated in this bootstrap. If you're just getting started with APEX, you can skip this section and return to it later when you're ready to explore the more sophisticated capabilities.*

### Understanding Rule Chaining Patterns

The bootstrap demonstrates two powerful rule chaining patterns that enable sophisticated validation logic:

#### 1. Conditional Chaining Pattern

**What it is:** A pattern that makes binary decisions based on trigger conditions, branching execution based on whether a condition is met.

**When to use it:**
- When you need "if-then-else" logic
- For eligibility checks before expensive processing
- When different validation paths are needed based on data characteristics

**How it works:**
1. **Trigger rule** evaluates a condition
2. If trigger passes → execute "on-trigger" rules
3. If trigger fails → execute "on-no-trigger" rules

**Example from the bootstrap:**
```yaml
trigger-rule:
  condition: "tradeId != null && counterpartyId != null && clientId != null"
conditional-rules:
  on-trigger:
    - id: "notional-positive"
      condition: "notionalAmount != null && notionalAmount > 0"
  on-no-trigger:
    - id: "basic-validation-failure"
      condition: "true"
      message: "Basic field validation failed"
```

#### 2. Accumulative Chaining Pattern

**What it is:** A pattern that builds up a score across multiple rule evaluations, with each rule contributing weighted points to a total score.

**When to use it:**
- For weighted scoring systems
- When you need graduated responses (approve/warn/reject)
- For risk assessment with multiple criteria

**How it works:**
1. Each rule contributes points based on its weight
2. Points are accumulated into a total score
3. Decision thresholds determine the final outcome

**Example from the bootstrap:**
```yaml
accumulative-rules:
  - id: "maturity-eligibility"
    condition: "maturityDate != null && maturityDate.isBefore(tradeDate.plusYears(5))"
    weight: 25
  - id: "currency-consistency"
    condition: "notionalCurrency == paymentCurrency"
    weight: 20
thresholds:
  approval-score: 70
  warning-score: 50
```

##### **Template-Based Business Rules Chain (Lines 37-75) - Detailed Analysis**

The **Template-Based Business Rules Chain** demonstrates APEX's intermediate API layer, designed for sophisticated business logic validation with weighted scoring. This chain uses the **accumulative chaining pattern** to build comprehensive validation scores across multiple business criteria.

**Understanding Accumulative Chaining Pattern:**

**What is Accumulative Chaining?**
Accumulative chaining is a pattern that builds up a score or result across multiple rule evaluations. Unlike conditional chaining (which makes binary decisions), accumulative chaining **accumulates weighted values** from multiple sources to create a comprehensive business score.

**Key Configuration Elements:**

1. **`accumulative-rules`**
   - **Purpose**: List of rules that each contribute to the total score
   - **Execution**: All rules execute (unlike conditional chaining)
   - **Contribution**: Each rule's condition result is multiplied by its weight and added to the total

2. **`weight`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines the relative importance of each rule
   - **Scale**: Numeric values representing business priority
   - **Usage**: Higher weights indicate more critical business rules

3. **`thresholds`**
   - **Purpose**: Define decision boundaries based on accumulated scores
   - **approval-score**: Minimum score for full approval (70 points)
   - **warning-score**: Minimum score for conditional approval (50 points)

**Step-by-Step Execution Flow:**

```
Initial State: totalScore = 0

Step 1: Execute maturity-eligibility rule
├── Condition: "maturityDate != null && maturityDate.isBefore(tradeDate.plusYears(5))"
├── Evaluation: Check if maturity date is within 5 years of trade date
├── Weight: 25 points
├── Result: TRUE → 25 points, FALSE → 0 points
└── Running Score: totalScore = 0 + 25 = 25

Step 2: Execute currency-consistency rule
├── Condition: "notionalCurrency == paymentCurrency && paymentCurrency == settlementCurrency"
├── Evaluation: Check if all currency fields match
├── Weight: 20 points
├── Result: TRUE → 20 points, FALSE → 0 points
└── Running Score: totalScore = 25 + 20 = 45

Step 3: Execute settlement-terms rule
├── Condition: "settlementDays != null && settlementDays >= 0 && settlementDays <= 5"
├── Evaluation: Check if settlement period is 0-5 days
├── Weight: 15 points
├── Result: TRUE → 15 points, FALSE → 0 points
└── Running Score: totalScore = 45 + 15 = 60

Step 4: Execute energy-commodity-validation rule
├── Condition: "commodityType == 'ENERGY' && (referenceIndex == 'WTI' || referenceIndex == 'BRENT' || referenceIndex == 'HENRY_HUB')"
├── Evaluation: Check if energy commodity uses valid index
├── Weight: 30 points
├── Result: TRUE → 30 points, FALSE → 0 points
└── Final Score: totalScore = 60 + 30 = 90

Step 5: Apply thresholds
├── Final Score: 90 points
├── Threshold Check: 90 >= 70 (approval-score)? YES
└── Decision: APPROVED
```

**Mathematical Scoring Algorithm:**

**Maximum Possible Score:**
- **Maturity Eligibility**: 25 points (25% of decision)
- **Currency Consistency**: 20 points (20% of decision)
- **Settlement Terms**: 15 points (15% of decision)
- **Commodity Validation**: 30 points (30% of decision)
- **Total Maximum**: 90 points

**Decision Thresholds:**
- **≥70 points**: `APPROVED` - Full validation passed
- **≥50 points**: `WARNING` - Conditional approval with monitoring
- **<50 points**: `REJECTED` - Insufficient business rule compliance

**Business Rationale for Weights:**
- **Commodity Validation (30 points)**: Highest priority - ensures proper asset classification
- **Maturity Eligibility (25 points)**: High priority - prevents excessive term risk
- **Currency Consistency (20 points)**: Medium priority - operational efficiency
- **Settlement Terms (15 points)**: Lower priority - operational convenience

          condition: "true"
          message: "TradeB ID format validation failed"
          description: "TradeB ID does not follow required format"
```

**Understanding Advanced SpEL Expressions:**

**1. Regex Pattern Matching:**
```
condition: "tradeId != null && tradeId.matches('^TRS[0-9]{3}$')"
```
- **Null Safety**: Ensures tradeId exists before pattern matching
- **Regex Pattern**: `^TRS[0-9]{3}$` matches exactly "TRS" followed by 3 digits
- **Examples**: "TRS001" ✓, "TRS123" ✓, "TR001" ✗, "TRS12" ✗, "TRS1234" ✗
- **Business Logic**: Enforces standardized trade ID format for system integration

**2. Numeric Range Validation:**
```
condition: "notionalAmount >= 1000000 && notionalAmount <= 100000000"
```
- **Lower Bound**: $1,000,000 minimum notional (risk management threshold)
- **Upper Bound**: $100,000,000 maximum notional (exposure limit)
- **Data Type**: BigDecimal comparison with automatic precision handling
- **Business Logic**: Ensures trades fall within acceptable risk parameters

**3. Multi-Field Null Checking:**
```
condition: "jurisdiction != null && regulatoryRegime != null"
```
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Both jurisdiction and regime must be specified
- **Examples**: jurisdiction="US" + regulatoryRegime="DODD_FRANK" ✓
- **Business Logic**: Ensures proper regulatory classification for compliance reporting

**4. Basis Points Validation:**
```
condition: "fundingSpread != null && fundingSpread >= 0 && fundingSpread <= 1000"
```
- **Range**: 0 to 1000 basis points (0% to 10%)
- **Null Safety**: Ensures funding spread is specified
- **Business Logic**: Prevents unrealistic funding costs that could indicate data errors

**Advanced Configuration Execution Flow:**

```

**Configuration Flexibility and Business Impact:**

**1. Configurable Thresholds:**
```yaml
# Current configuration
configuration:
  thresholds:
    minNotionalAmount: 1000000      # $1M minimum
    maxNotionalAmount: 100000000    # $100M maximum
    maxFundingSpread: 1000          # 1000 basis points (10%)

# Conservative configuration (lower risk tolerance)
configuration:
  thresholds:
    minNotionalAmount: 5000000      # $5M minimum
    maxNotionalAmount: 50000000     # $50M maximum
    maxFundingSpread: 500           # 500 basis points (5%)

# Aggressive configuration (higher risk tolerance)
configuration:
  thresholds:
    minNotionalAmount: 500000       # $500K minimum
    maxNotionalAmount: 250000000    # $250M maximum
    maxFundingSpread: 1500          # 1500 basis points (15%)
```

**2. Regex Pattern Customization:**
```yaml
# Standard format: TRS###
tradeIdPattern: "^TRS[0-9]{3}$"

# Extended format: TRS-YYYY-###
tradeIdPattern: "^TRS-[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}$"

# Multi-asset format: (TRS|FWD|OPT)###
