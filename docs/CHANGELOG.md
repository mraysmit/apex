- **Financial Rules**: Balance checks, transaction limits, KYC verification

### 🛠️ Usage Examples

#### Ultra-Simple API
```java
// One-liner evaluation
boolean result = Rules.check("#age >= 18", Map.of("age", 25));

// Named rules for reuse
Rules.define("adult", "#age >= 18");
boolean isAdult = Rules.test("adult", customer);

// Fluent validation
boolean valid = Rules.validate(customer)
    .minimumAge(18)
    .emailRequired()
    .passes();
```

#### Template-Based Rules
```java
// Validation rule set
RulesEngine validation = RuleSet.validation()
    .ageCheck(18)
    .emailRequired()
    .phoneRequired()
    .build();

// Business rule set
RulesEngine business = RuleSet.business()
    .premiumEligibility("#balance > 5000")
    .discountEligibility("#age > 65")
    .build();
```

#### Detailed Validation
```java
ValidationResult result = Rules.validate(customer)
    .minimumAge(18)
    .emailRequired()
    .that("#balance >= 0", "Balance cannot be negative")
    .validate();

if (!result.isValid()) {
    result.getErrors().forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing patterns continue to work

#### Migration Path
```java
// Existing code (still works)
RulesEngineConfiguration config = new RulesEngineConfiguration();
Rule rule = config.rule("id").withName("name").build();

// New simple approach (optional upgrade)
boolean result = Rules.check("#age >= 18", customer);

// New structured approach (for complex scenarios)
RulesEngine engine = RuleSet.validation().ageCheck(18).build();
```
